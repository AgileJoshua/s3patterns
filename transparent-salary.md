# Fairness

* perception of fairness is **specific to organization**
 and **changes over time**.
* fairness has multiple orthogonal dimensions
    * **fairness of equivalence**: e.g. one person, one vote
    * **fairness of need**: e.g. to compensate for social background, illness, hungry mouths to feed etc.
    * **fairness of efficiency and merit**: experience, productivity, education
    * **fairness of proportionality**: e.g. full-time vs. part-time

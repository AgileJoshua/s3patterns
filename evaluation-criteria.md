title: Evaluation Criteria
---

Evaluation criteria help you understand whether or not an agreement has the desired effect. 

Make them simple and  unambiguous so you avoid discussing opinions when reviewing your agreements: Go for "the number of items sent back from the customer for re-work should have dropped from 10 per week to 5 or less by January 10th" instead of "Quality is improved.."

One very effective way of defining Evaluation Criteria is as *actionable metrics*, i.e. a set of measurements which you can continuously refer to to see whether you're on the right track. Actionable metrics make it easy to spot deviations from your intended outcome, and to take action accordingly. Consider this example: you have a steady trickle of new users for your website, and you want to increase popularity of your site. If you track number of website users per day, the graph will rise even without your new agreements being effective. However, tracking new users per day will give you a much clearer picture, if this metric is increasing, you know you're on the right track, and if it's shrinking, you know that you need to get together and take action.

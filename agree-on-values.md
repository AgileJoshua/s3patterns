title: Agree On Values 
---

A pattern for setting boundaries for behavior, decisions and actions by adopting a set of  values that is shared throughout an organization.

**Motivation for this pattern:** Culture in an organization is formed through implicit assumptions or explicit agreements about acceptable behavior. Agreements and assumptions can vary throughout an organization. 

Making an explicit commitment to aligning behavior, decisions and actions along shared values improves effectiveness. A **value** is a principle of some significance that guides behavior. **Chosen values** are an intentional and collaborative effort to create the culture people want to see in an organization. 


## Indicators for using this pattern


### Conditions:

* lack of shared understanding of the ethical boundaries of decisions and actions across an organization
* more or less radically different cultures in different parts of an organization
* culture in an organization appears to impede greater effectiveness

  
### Needs:

* bring members of an organization closer together and align teams
* develop norms that compliment objectives
* reduce investment required for making effective decisions

  
## The details ##

When discussing shared values, it can be challenging for the members of an organization to identify and articulate their shared intrinsic values, because their personal values meet with **explicit and implicit assumptions about expected and appropriate behavior** in the organization. Additionally these assumptions may depend on context, e.g. people behave differently when a CEO is present in a meeting,  and there's often different cultures in different parts of the organizations, e.g. in engineering, sales and management.

Therefore it's usually easier for people to focus on what behavior they consider as supportive of effective collaboration. 

These are their **chosen values** - the set of values members agree on and commit to in an intentional and collaborative effort of aligning towards both achieving organizational objectives and growing the kind of culture they want to see.

Chosen values support effectiveness of an organization by:

* offering **guidance** to determine appropriate action or behavior, often reducing the need for more specific agreements.
* reducing potential for **misunderstanding**
* **aligning** decision making and action
* **inviting contribution** of all its members
* **attracting new members, partners and customers** in natural alignment with the organization


### Putting it into practice ###

Since commitment to a set of chosen values is an experiment, an organization benefits from developing strategies for:

* supporting each other in developing shared understanding of the values and for applying them consistently
* learning when values might be updated, refined, or even dropped
* responding to situations where individuals suspect  a value may have been compromised or overlooked
* discovering and changing existing practices or agreements that stand in the way of adopting a shared value

As an organization grows structure it is natural that different flavors of culture evolve in different domains. Alignment with chosen values across an entire organization allows for diversity without compromising the wellbeing of the organization.


### Articulating values ###

In order to make chosen values as helpful as possible, consider these guidelines:

1. Agree on the motivation for each value first and imagine the culture that's desired.
2. Limit chosen values to 5-7 if possible.
3. Express values in concrete terms that people can act on, rather than as abstract concepts.
4. Create a visual representation of each value.
5. Make chosen values visible everywhere in the organization so it's easy to remember and refer to them.
6. Make culture a priority, and get together on a regular basis to understand, develop and evolve values, e.g. twice a year in an open space (see *Open S3 Adoption*).

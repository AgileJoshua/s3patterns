title: Objections
---

**Definition:** _An objection is a reason why doing what is proposed stands in the way of (more) effective satisfaction of an existing driver._

In sociocracy we deliberately seek objections as they reveal
wisdom that can be used to improve proposals and agreements.   

Objections...

* ...are gifts
* ...reveal wisdom seeking expression into the consciousness of a circle
* ...reveal opportunities or impediments
* ...emerge through individuals and belong to the whole circle
* we love objections in sociocracy


## Questions That Help to Validate Objections ##

* Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?

* Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or existing) **agreement**...

    * ...jeopardizes the satisfaction of a driver?
    * ...is in conflict with the organization's values?
    * ...prevents or diminishes someone's contribution to satisfying a driver?
    * ...can be improved significantly?


# Concerns... #

* ...are not objections
* ...don't stop us from making agreements
* ...often contain wisdom 
* ...can be recorded in the logbook
    * ...to further evolve agreements
    * ...to set evaluation criteria (including review date)

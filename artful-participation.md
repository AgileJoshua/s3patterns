title: Artful Participation
---

A commitment to developing helpful interactions and effective collaboration.


**Motivation for this pattern**: People wishing to collaborate effectively benefit from identifying, understanding and developing the necessary skills to engage with each other, and with their chosen practices, processes and all agreements they make.

**Artful participation** is the commitment of an individual to participate in a proactive, coherent and elegant way in all aspects of collaboration in teams and organizations they are a part of.


## Indicators for using this pattern


### Conditions:

* People disengaged or not fully engaged
* People unsure how to contribute
* Ineffective participation, despite explicit agreements * Dysfunctional communication


### Needs:

* Effective collaboration
* Engagement
* People accountable for their agreements and actions
* Helpful interactions


## The Details

Being accountable is a learned skill and while making an agreement may be (relatively) easy, keeping up with the implications is hard: many agreements require discovering necessary skills and developing them.

Intentional commitment to agreements amplifies learning, and the more participants learn about how to support agreements, the more they learn about the agreements themselves.

Intentional effort of participants to support each other makes stronger teams and full engagement makes happy people, better agreements, and closer collaboration.


### Elements of  Artful Participation ###

A brief guide for what makes collaboration effective, and how to develop accountability for agreements:

Artful participation is a individual commitment toâ€¦

* actively keeping and following-up on all agreements made, in the best way possible, given the circumstances
* consciously balancing personal needs with those of a team and the organization as a whole 
* developing the necessary skills to do so
* supporting others in doing the same 

Whenever the individual discovers impediments or obstacles to their contribution or to existing agreements, which they can't resolve on their own, they bring them to the attention of everyone involved in the agreement to resolve the problem together.

Although anyone can commit to artful participation on their own, the effect is much greater when a full team or even an entire organization embraces artful participation together.


### Some questions to help with artful participation:

* How will I support myself and others in participating more artfully? 
* Where are my interactions with others not particularly helpful or effective?
* Which are the agreements I find hard to keep or contribute to? What can I do to change that?
* What are skills that would support me in artful participation?
* What would artful participation mean in relation to...
	* ... my daily activities 
	* ...collaboration and interaction with others?
	* ...the organization? ...our clients?
	* ...the wider environment?

title: Nested Circle

A pattern for expanding the capacity of a function.

![](img/structural-patterns/nested-circle.png)

When a team finds that a function required for them to deliver value needs more capacity, but the team wants to avoid the side-effects of adding more people to the team, it can form a nested circle to add more people for that function. 

Coordination between the outer circle and the nested circle happens through one or several members of the outer team, who are also members of the nested circle. Often nested circles grow out of a role, so initially those who held that role are usually best suited for coordination. As with all other roles, it's a good idea to assign them for a limited term, and use [Role Selection][].

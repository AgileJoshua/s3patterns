A pattern for outsourcing shared services

![A Service Circle](img/structural-patterns/service-circle.png)

When several teams identify a service they can share, each team selects a delegate to a service circle. The service circle can then increase its capacity by bringing in more people. The delegates remain in the service circle to ensure development of the circle is in line with the needs of the founding circles.

Delegates are selected for a limited term, and can be recalled if the team feels the delegate does not represent them well.

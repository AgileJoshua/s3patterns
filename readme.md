# S3 eBook

This is a fork of the early stages of the S3 handbook, updated with my drafts for several patterns where an "official" version does not yet exist. 

I use it as a handout in my S3 workshops, and as recommended reading for people interested in S3. 

As new patterns are finished by me and James Priest, I will continue updating this ebook until it becomes obsolete through the release of the full handbook.

## Cross-references

Since the github pages use jekyll to build the site, and preprocessing the pages is not possible, links to patterns must be in a form jekyll understands, i.e. '[Link Text](filename.md)'. The handbook, however, needs MultiMarktdown crossreferences, i.e. [Pattern Name][] or [something][Pattern Name].

The handbook builder attempts to parse all links to a Markdown file with an link to a pattern file using the pattern names in s3_patterns.py.

# S3 eBook

This is a fork of the early stages of the S3 handbook, updated with my drafts for several patterns where an "official" version does not yet exist. 

I use it as a handout in my S3 workshops, and as recommended reading for people interested in S3. 

As new patterns are finished by me and James Priest, I will continue updating this ebook until it becomes obsolete through the release of the full handbook.

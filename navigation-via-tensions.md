---


**Definition**:  _A tension is the subjective experience of contradiction between reality and that which we desire or anticipate._

* individuals act as sensors (nerve endings) for the organization
* tension is experienced whenever our perception of our environment is in conflict with:
    * that which we desire or had anticipated
    * our values (and principles)
* problems, challenges, and feelings of unease are all tensions

## From Tension to Driver ##
  
* investigating tension leads to the discovery of drivers
* to identify a possible driver behind a tension we:
    * **describe** the current reality
    * **identify** the needs we associate with that reality 
* in the process, we resolve some tensions as **misunderstandings**
* we validate drivers
    * some tensions are **outside the domain** we can address

title: Open S3 Adoption
---


Instead of mandating S3, the formal authorities make the call for members of the organization to get together in an Open Space and invite them to co-create experiments they'd like to conduct around S3 patterns. This usually happens after some small experiments in an organization demonstrated the potential of S3. 

Conducting the first Open Space:

* explain boundaries for experiments: S3 principles and patterns
* explain Open Space rules and principle
* co-create agenda
* provide space to share experiences and ideas between sessions
* provide a platform for announcing initiatives and experiments
* announce next Open Space

In regular intervals, usually twice a year, the whole organization will get together again in an Open Spaces to evaluate experiment and design new ones. In between Open Spaces formal authorities support the experiments and collect stories.

This pattern is based on OpenSpace agility (formerly Open Agile Adoption) by Dan Mezick.

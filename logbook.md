A logbook is a (digital) system to store all information relevant for the running an organizations or circle. The logbook is accessible to all members of an organization, information is hidden only when there is a good reason to do so.

Suitable platforms for logbooks are Wikis, Web CMS Systems, and other web- or multi-platform applications. 

Essential requirements for a logbook system:

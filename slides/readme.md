# slides

This is a slide deck for teaching all patterns. The deck is built as a deckset version and as a reveal.js version.

Patterns are grouped in directories per patterns group and built using a build script. Input format is deckset, i.e. slide separators are "---".

The image folder is symlinked to all subfolders, so images can easily be added without relative paths.

## Markdown Styleguide

Information in this section is preliminary, and needs further testing.

* Images always float right (because that works without clearing the float), and are set to height of 100%. Floating images go BEFORE the text, and are marked "right,fit"
* single images on slides: [inline,fit]
* Headline Level 1 is always the only content on the slide (apart from background images)
* Headline level 2  or more is increased by one for reveal.js


TODO: translate background images

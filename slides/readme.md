# slides

This is a slide deck for teaching all patterns. The deck is built as a deckset version and as a reveal.js version.

Patterns are grouped in directories per patterns group and built using a buildscript. Input format is deckset, i.e. slide separators are "---".

The image folder is symlinked to all subfolders, so images can easily be added without relative paths.

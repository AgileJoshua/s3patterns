# Making And Evolving Agreements



---

## Agreements


We respond to drivers through agreements.

**Definition:** _A agreement is an agreed upon guideline, pattern, process or protocol designed to guide the flow of value._

---

* agreements are created in order to respond to drivers 
* agreements are the **accountability of the circle** that created them
* each agreement includes **evaluation criteria** and is subject to **regular review**
    *  review dates are specific to each agreement
    *  agreements are reviewed in context to its driver

---

---

## Template for Agreements

---

## Circle

A circle...

* ...is the basic building block of an organization
* ...is a group of people gathered around a driver (permanent or temporary)
* ...makes all agreements by consent
* ...is accountable for its own development

---

**Definition:** _A circle is a semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing group of people gathering around a driver._

![](img/circle/circle-driver.png)  

---

* ...**semi-autonomous**: 
    * each has a unique driver and can create value independently
* ...**self-organizing**:
    * independent in organizing day-to-day-work
* ...**self-governing**:
    * independent in creating strategy and agreements

---

## Consent Decision Making


* Consent is the absence of objections
    * everyone affected by a decision can "live with it"
    * consent is not consensus with unanimity
* Consent is used to make and evolve all agreements in a circle
* Objections stop proposals becoming agreements
* Withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization
* Being able to raise objections at any time means that proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*
* Every agreement has a review date 

---

## Consent Decision Making...

* is a facilitated decision making process
* deliberately harvests reasoned objections in order to integrate the wisdom they contain in proposals or existing agreements
* helps balance equivalence and effectiveness
* experienced groups can move quickly through the stages of Consent Decision Making 

---

## Harvesting Objections to Capture Emergent Wisdom ##

![](img/agreements/cdm-condensed.png)



---

## Deliverables



---

## Driver

_A driver is that which motivates us into action: what is happening in a specific situation and what’s needed._

# Responses to a Driver #

* the response to a driver always involves the **adaptation of an existing agreement, or creation of a new one**, including:
    * changing the plan: adding a task or project
    * adaptation or creation of a role
    * creation of a new circle
        * driver review is delegated to new circle

---

## Drivers Are Subject to Regular Review ##

* Is the description of the situation still correct?
* Do we still associate the same needs with the situation?
* Is the driver still within our domain?
* Is the driver still relevant?

---

### Value and Waste ###

_**Value** is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in responding to a driver._

**Value**:

* value is **not** an **inherent** property as it only exists in relation to a driver
* value can be quantified by **measuring the progress** of responding to driver
    * value is not necessarily expressed in currency or time
* **continuous improvement of processes is focused on optimizing the flow of value through an organization**

**Waste** _is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

Adopting the concept of value and waste makes many tools and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** available to support organizations running on Sociocracy 3.0:

* value stream mapping
* various strategies for eliminating waste
* the Kanban Method

---

### Waste and Continuous Improvement ###

* Establishing a process for ongoing elimination of waste enables natural evolution of an organization towards greater effectiveness
* Adaptation to changing environment is built into the process

---

### Identifying Waste ###

![](img/workflow-and-value/drivers-value-waste.png)

* waste exist in many different forms and on different levels of abstraction
    * tasks, processes, organizational structure, mental models...
* some tensions reveal waste
* learning to identify waste is a journey
    * along the way we also learn how to evolve our drivers




---

## Evaluate Agreements



---

## Evaluation Criteria



---

## Intended Outcome



---

## Objections

_An **objection** is an importan reason why doing what is proposed stands in the way of (more) effective response toan existing driver._

In sociocracy we deliberately seek objections as they potentially reveal information that can be used to improve proposals and agreements.   

---

Objections...

* ...reveal wisdom seeking expression into the consciousness of a circle
* ...reveal opportunities or impediments
* ...emerge through individuals and belong to the whole circle

---

## Questions That Help to Validate Objections ##

* Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?
* Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or existing) **agreement**...

    * ...jeopardizes the response to a driver?
    * ...is in conflict with the organization's values?
    * ...prevents or diminishes someone's contribution to responding to a driver?
    * ...can be improved significantly?

---

# Concerns... #

* ...are not objections
* ...are not important enough to prevent an agreement
* ...often contain wisdom 
* ...can be recorded in the logbook
    * ...to further evolve agreements
    * ...to set evaluation criteria (including review date)




---

## Proposal Forming


Proposal Forming...

* ...is similar to condensed design thinking process
* ...taps the collective intelligence of a group
* ...involves people in co-creating agreements
* ...fosters accountability and a sense of ownership


![Co-Creating a Response to a Drivers](img/agreements/proposal-forming-medium.png)

---
  
## Proposal Forming Process ##

1. **Identify** the driver 
2. **Consider**: Collect considerations as questions that reveal the scope of the issue
3. **Create**: Gather ingredients/ideas for solutions
4. **Refine**: Design a proposal from some or all of the ingredients
5. **Review**: process with consent decision making
  



---

## Qualifying Drivers


** ...in order to avoid action bias**

>_Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom._ (Viktor E. Frankl)

We consider why, how and when to respond to a stimulus, instead of defaulting to action.





---

## Resolve Objections

# Methods for Resolving Objections #

* ask proposal owner
* ask member with objection to amend proposal
* facilitator amends proposal
* "How would you solve this" – round
* Brief Dialogue – 2 or 3 people
* Brief group discussion
* refer to proposal forming
* drop the proposal
* Re-work – Send back to higher / lower circle
* Form a temporary circle to review, research, revise


---

## Strategy



---

## Those Affected Decide



---

# Governance



---

## Governance Backlog



---

## Governance Meeting



Circles meet at regular intervals to create and evolve agreements in response to drivers.

* usually ~60 min
* regular cadence, usually 2-4 weeks

---

## Governance Meeting Structure

* Opening Round
    * attune to one another and to the driver the circle serves
* Administrative Matters
    * consent to last minutes, dates, consent to agenda
* Agenda Items
    * Short Reports
    * Processing Tensions
    * Proposal Forming and Consent to Proposals
    * Review of Agreements, Strategy and Driver
    * Defining Roles and Selecting People for Roles
    * Consent to Role Improvement Plans
* Closing Round
    * evaluation of meeting and results, future agenda items





---

## Navigating Via Tension

* individuals act as sensors for the organization
* tension is experienced whenever our perception of our environment is in conflict with:
    * that which we desire or had anticipated
    * our values (and principles)
* problems, challenges, and feelings of unease are all tensions

![](img/tension-driver-domain/navigate-via-tensions.png)

---

## From Tension to Driver ##
  
* investigating tension leads to the discovery of drivers
* to identify a possible driver behind a tension we:
    * **describe** the situation
    * **identify** the needs we associate with that reality 
* in the process, we resolve some tensions as **misunderstandings**
* we validate drivers
    * some tensions are **outside the domain** we can address 


---

# Effective Meetings



---

## S3 Facilitator



---

## Artful Participation



---

## Logbook

A logbook is a (digital) system to store all information relevant for the running an organizations or circle. The logbook is accessible to all members of an organization, information is hidden only when there is a good reason to do so.

* Organization: 
    * driver, strategy
    * organizational values
    * organizational structure
    * agreements 

* Circle: 
    * driver, strategy
    * agreements
    * role definitions and role improvement plans

* Personal logbooks
    * role descriptions
    * tasks
    * personal strategy and personal policy



---

## Logbook Keeper



---

## Meeting Evaluation



---

## Meeting Facilitation



---

## Meeting Host



---

## Rounds


A group facilitation technique to maintain equivalence.

1. Pick a random person to start
    * begin with a different person each time to maintain equivalence
2. Go around the circle, give everyone the chance to speak

There's  a number of ways that experienced groups can fast track certain rounds.

# Coordinating Work



---

## Coordination Meeting



---

## Coordinator Role



---

## Daily Standup


**Speed up learning and improvement.**

* ~15 min
* every day at the same time
* circle gathers around the task board
* coordination of daily work
* adaptation of existing agreements or creation of new agreements on the spot


---

## Planning And Review Meetings



---

## Prioritized Backlog



---

## Pull-System For Work



---

## Retrospective

**Reflect on a longer period of work and improve agreements.**

* ~60 min
* cadence, usually 2-4 weeks
* helps seeing the bigger picture, and identifying more complex types of waste
* What can we learn from the last iteration of work?
* Are our tools still sharp enough?
* Are we still going in the right direction?


---

**Retrospective: Building in continuous improvement of process:**

* goal: reflection on the past to guide process improvement
* output: proposals for agreements, tensions, drivers or tasks
* facilitated meeting (~1hr)
* regular intervals (1-4 weeks)
* adapt to situation and context: 
    * 5 phases with many different patterns for each phase 

---

## Retrospective: A time to reflect on process improvement ##

![](img/meetings/retrospective.png)

---

## 5 Phases of a Retrospective Meeting ##

1. Set the Stage 
2. Gather Data
3. Generate Insights
4. Decide What to Do
5. Close the Retrospective

Activities for each phase can be found at [plans-for-retrospectives.com](http://www.plans-for-retrospectives.com/)

## Visualize Work



---

# Building Organizations



---

## Align Flow


### Flow of Value ###

* flow of value is guided by agreements (explicit and implicit), and assumptions
* work in progress is considered waste as it ties up resources
* continuous flow of value prevents accumulation of waste
    * it also makes for shorter feedback loops and amplifies learning

---

### Flow of Value and Flow of Information ###

![](img/workflow-and-value/types-of-flow.png)

* in an effective organization, the **flow of information and influence supports the continuous flow of value**
* alignment is achieved and maintained through continuous improvement of agreements

# People And Roles



---

## Development Plan


**Contents:**

* current role description
* appreciations
* areas for improvement
* action items to improve effectiveness
* evaluation criteria
* suggested amendments to role description



---

## Effectiveness Review

* a process to harvest appreciations, identify opportunities for improvement and evolve the role
* the individual holding the role initiates the process and begins each step


## Steps

1. Invite people with complementing perspectives to contribute to the review, and a facilitator
2. Collect appreciations
3. Identify areas for improvement
    * personal development
    * updates to role description, function or driver 
4. Co-create and consent to a development plan


![](img/people-and-roles/effectiveness-review.png)



---

## Role



---

## Role Description

* role descriptions can be created using proposal forming 
* a minimal role description contains:

    * driver
    * term
    * key responsibilities
    * preferable skills, experience and qualities
    * cadence of effectiveness reviews

---

## Template for Role Descriptions

![](img/people-and-roles/role-description-template.png)


---

## Role Selection


![](img/people-and-roles/selection.png)

* People avoid expressing interest before elections 
* Nominations are made on the strength of the reason
    * not according to the majority
* You can nominate yourself or pass
* When harvesting objections, ask the candidate last
* Objections may be resolved by amending the role description or by nominating someone else


---

## Support Roles



---

# Organizational Structure


The primary function of organizational structure is **to enable effective collaboration** by aligning the flow of information to  support the flow of value..  

**Organizational structure needs to evolve continuously** in order to adapt to a changing environment.

**Semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing circles** are the basic building blocks for organizational structure.

---

## Structural Patterns ##

* Sociocracy 3.0 describes a variety of patterns to grow organizational structure
* patterns apply to different layers of abstraction (basic, micro, macro and meta)
* different patterns serve different drivers
* patterns can be combined as needed
* more patterns are out there and will be discovered


---

## Backbone Organization

A pattern for multi-stakeholder projects or services.

---

## Double Linking

![](img/structural-patterns/double-link.png)

##Facilitate two-way flow of information and influence##

* Two interdependent circles each elect a representative to participate as full members in both circles' governance meetings
* can be used to prevent tensions in hierarchical structures


---

Periphery drives the organization, the center provides services.

![](img/structural-patterns/peach-organization.png)


---

## Representative

Representatives (a.k.a Links)...:

* ...stand for the interests of one circle in another circle
* ...are elected for a limited term
* ...participate as full members in governance meetings of the other circle and can:
    * raise items for the agenda
    * object to agreements and proposals



---

## Service Circle


A pattern for outsourcing shared services

## Adopt The Seven Principles


* values embrace Sociocracy 3.0 principles
* collaboration follows principles and values


![](img/collaboration-values/values-step3.png)




---

## Agree On Values


**Definition:** *A value is a principle of some significance that guides behavior.*

* In an organization people come together to collaborate
* every individual has values that are influenced by their experiences and beliefs
* values may define ethical limitations to action

![](img/collaboration-values/values-step2.png)

* organizational values **define culture** and set parameters for action
* values offer guidance to determine appropriate action, even in the absence of explicit agreements
* a group or organization may **choose to collectively adopt values**
* defining values is a **strategy** that supports effectiveness of an organization:
    * reduces potential for **misunderstanding**
    * **aligns** decision making and action
    * **attracts new members, partners and customers** who are aligned with the organization
* values are an agreement, and thus subject to **regular reviews**




---

## Bylaws



---

## Contracting And Accountability

![](img/circle/enter-leave-circle.png)

* define the process for entering the organization
* define default role for a new member
* define the process for leaving an organization




---

## Linking

### Connecting two circles ###

![](img/structural-patterns/link.png)



---

## Transparent Salary

* transparent salaries need to be fair
* fairness has several orthogonal dimensions
* perception of fairness is specific to organization
* consider members and relevant stakeholders (e.g. investors)
* classic sociocracy: everyone feels gains and losses
* consider remuneration for changing roles
* create strategy for transitioning towards new contracts and compensation agreements

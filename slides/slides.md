## Making And Evolving Agreements

### S3 promotes a hypothesis-driven approach to decision making

![inline,fit](img/experiments/experiments.png)

---

## Agreement Life-Cycle

![inline,fit](img/agreements/agreement-lifecycle-long.png)


---


## Patterns in this group

* Agreements
* Circle
* Consent Decision Making
* Deliverables
* Driver
* Evaluate Agreements
* Evaluation Criteria
* Intended Outcome
* Objections
* Proposal Forming
* Qualifying Drivers
* Resolve Objections
* Strategy
* Those Affected Decide


---

## Agreements

![right,fit](img/tension-driver-domain/driver-agreement-improvement.png)

_An **agreement** is an agreed upon guideline, pattern, process or protocol designed to guide the flow of value._

* agreements are created in order to respond to drivers 
* agreements are the **accountability of the circle** that created them
* each agreement includes **evaluation criteria** and is subject to **regular review**

---

## Template for Agreements

![inline,fit](img/agreements/agreement-template.png)



---

## Circle

![right,fit](img/circle/circle-driver.png)  

_A **circle** is a semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing group of people gathering around a driver._

A circle...

* ...is the basic building block of an organization
* ...may be permanent or temporary
* ...makes all agreements by consent
* ...is accountable for its own development

---

## Circle (cont.)

* ...**semi-autonomous**: 
    * each has a unique driver and can create value independently
* ...**self-organizing**:
    * independent in organizing day-to-day-work
* ...**self-governing**:
    * independent in creating strategy and agreements

---

## Consent Decision Making

![right,fit](img/agreements/cdm-condensed.png)

* facilitated decision making process
* collect objections from everyone affected and integrate the wisdom they contain in proposals or existing agreements
* withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization
* unresolved objections stop proposals becoming agreements
* can you *live with it* until the review? ➤ proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*

---

## Contact of Consent

* in the absence of objections against an agreement you support following through on the agreement as good as possible
* as soon as you become aware of an objection, or a tension with the agreement, you bring it to the circle to process it.




---

## Deliverables

A **deliverable** is something which is provided as a result of an agreement, usually framed as a product, a service, or an expectation.

**Describing deliverables:**

* goal: shared understanding
* include reasonable amount of detail
* reference other documents when helpful or necessary

---

## Deliverables (cont.)

Deliverables are useful for: 

* organizational strategy
* circle strategy
* development plans
* role descriptions
* process policy
* any other agreement


---

## Driver

![right,fit](img/drivers-and-subdrivers/elements-of-a-driver-alt.png)

* **shared understanding** of our motivation for action (the "why")
* describes a **specific situation**: conditions and the **needs** we associate with it
* focus on the **present**, not future or assumptions
* precedes goals, objectives, aims, mission, vision, purpose
* **incrementally refined**, easy to review 

The response to a driver is usually an experiment, that evolves over time with what is learned along the way.

---

## Review of Drivers: ###

![right,fit](img/experiments/kaizen.png)

* Is the description of the situation still correct?
* Do we still associate the same needs with the situation?
* Is the driver still within our domain?
* Is the driver still relevant?

---

### Drivers: Value and Waste ###

_**Value** is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to responding to a driver._

**Waste** _is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

Adopting the concept of value and waste makes many tools and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** available to support organizations running on Sociocracy 3.0:

* value stream mapping
* various strategies for eliminating waste
* the Kanban Method






---

## Evaluate Agreements


The periodical review of agreements is an essential practice for a learning organization: continuously improving the body of agreements, and eliminating waste:

* adapt to changes in context
* integrate emerging knowledge
* adjust expectations and actual outcome

*Is the agreement still relevant?*

*Is the agreement still good enough for now and safe enough to try?*

*Is there a reason why NOT to continue with this agreement?*

---

## Evaluate Agreements (cont.)

![right,fit](img/agreements/evaluate-agreements.png)

* preparation
    * schedule review
    * update documents and metrics
    * prepare report(s) (optional)

* address consequences
    * agree on next review date
    * documentation / notification
    * tracking tasks and decisions
    * effects on related agreements

---

## Evaluate Agreements (cont.)

* schedule a separate session for updating agreement if necessary 
* review usually takes place in *Governance Meetings* 
* reviews are scheduled per agreement
* adjust review cadence with **expected stability** of the agreement
* trigger early review when necessary



---

## Evaluation Criteria

![right,fit](img/agreements/outcome-and-criteria.png)

Evaluation criteria help you understand whether or not an agreement has the desired effect. 

* go for **simple and unambiguous** criteria and document them (avoids discussing opinions when reviewing your agreements)
* define **actionable metrics**, to continuously track effects and spot deviations from your intended outcome


---

## Intended Outcome

![right,fit](img/agreements/outcome-and-criteria.png)

* brief description of the expected effects of agreement (or strategy)
* consider including specific *Evaluation Criteria* for a more effective review


---

## Objections

_An **objection** is an important reason why doing what is proposed stands in the way of (more) effective response to a driver._

Objections...

* ...stop proposals from becoming agreements.
* ...contain emergent information that can be used to improve proposals and agreements
* ...reveal both opportunities or impediments

---

## Objections


It's the decision of the individual who raised the objection to stay or withdraw the objection.

Withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization

Being able to raise objections at any time means that proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*

---

## Questions to Understand Objections ##

* Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?
* Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or existing) **agreement**...

    * ...jeopardizes the response to a driver?
    * ...is in conflict with the organization's values?
    * ...prevents or diminishes someone's contribution to responding to a driver?
    * ...can be improved significantly?

---

# Concerns... #

* ...are not objections
* ...are not important enough to prevent an agreement
* ...often contain wisdom 
* ...can be recorded in the logbook
    * ...to further evolve agreements
    * ...to set evaluation criteria (including review date)


---

## Proposal Forming

![right,fit](img/agreements/proposal-forming-medium.png)

Proposal Forming...

* ...is a facilitated format for co-creating a response to a drivers
* ...is similar to condensed design thinking process
* ...taps the collective intelligence of a group
* ...involves people in co-creating agreements
* ...fosters accountability and a sense of ownership

---
  
## Proposal Forming Process ##

1. **Identify** the driver 
2. **Consider**: Collect considerations as questions that reveal the scope of the issue
3. **Create**: Gather ingredients/ideas for solutions
4. **Refine**: Design a proposal from some or all of the ingredients
5. **Review**: process with consent decision making
  



---

## Qualifying Drivers


Consider why, how and when to respond to a stimulus, instead of defaulting to action.

>_Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom._ (Viktor E. Frankl)

* only act on **important** drivers
* take drivers to the **appropriate domain** (role or circle)
* both the individual sensing tension and the domain is accountable for making a conscious choice whether or not to act on the driver

---

![inline,fit](img/tension-driver-domain/qualify-drivers.png)


---

## Resolve Objections

### Methods for Resolving Objections ###

* ask proposal owner
* ask member with objection to amend proposal
* facilitator amends proposal
* "How would you solve this" – round
* Brief Dialogue – 2 or 3 people
* Brief group discussion
* refer to proposal forming
* drop the proposal
* Re-work – Send back to higher / lower circle
* Form a temporary circle to review, research, revise


---

## Strategy

![right,fit](img/tension-driver-domain/domain-model.png)

_A **strategy** is the approach towards creating value within a domain._

* describes high level approach 
    * not a detailed plan or a full product description
* an organization, circle or role can have their own strategy
* often includes a description of the intended outcome (a.k.a. "vision")
* is regularly reviewed and updated as necessary
* helps in the decision whether to continue or change course (*pivot or persevere*)

---

## Strategy

Strategies are implemented and refined through a serieses of experiments.

![inline](img/drivers-and-subdrivers/driver-strategy-experiment.png)


---

## Those Affected Decide

To make decisions with the maximum amount of information on the subject, involve everyone who is affected by the decision.

For large groups, facilitate a process in several stages and create smaller groups who select delegates.

This also applies to review and evolution of decisions.


---


![inline,fit](img/pattern-groups/group-2.png)



---


## Patterns in this group

* Governance Backlog
* Governance Meeting
* Navigating Via Tension


---

## Governance Backlog

The governance backlog is a prioritized list of agenda items a circle needs to deal with:

* tensions to process
* proposals
* agreements for review
* selections to roles
* upcoming effectiveness reviews
* other agenda items


---

## Governance Meeting

![right,fit](img/meetings/governance-meeting.png)

Circles meet at regular intervals to create and evolve agreements in response to drivers.

* usually ~60 min
* regular cadence, usually 2-4 weeks

---

## Governance Meeting Structure

* Opening Round
    * attune to one another and to the driver the circle serves
* Administrative Matters
    * consent to last minutes, dates, consent to agenda
* Agenda Items
    * Short Reports
    * Processing Tensions
    * Proposal Forming and Consent to Proposals
    * Review of Agreements, Strategy and Driver
    * Defining Roles and Selecting People for Roles
    * Consent to Role Improvement Plans
* Closing Round
    * evaluation of meeting and results, future agenda items





---

## Navigating Via Tension

![right,fit](img/tension-driver-domain/navigate-condensed.png)

* individuals act as sensors for the organization
* tensions arise whenever our perception of what is happening is in conflict with our **expectations** or our **values** (and principles)
* problems, challenges, and feelings of unease are all tensions
* investigating tension leads to the discovery of drivers
* to identify a possible driver behind a tension we:
    * **describe** the situation
    * **identify** the needs we associate with it 
* in the process, a tensions may be resolved as **misunderstandings**

---

## Navigating Via Tension


![inline,fit](img/tension-driver-domain/navigate-via-tensions-alt.png)



---


![inline,fit](img/pattern-groups/group-3.png)



---


## Patterns in this group

* S3 Facilitator
* Artful Participation
* Logbook
* Logbook Keeper
* Meeting Evaluation
* Meeting Facilitation
* Meeting Host
* Rounds


---

## Role: S3 Facilitator

![right,fit](img/circle/facilitator.png)

The facilitator supports the circle in developing their interactions and is responsible for making sure all meetings and workshops are facilitated and evaluated, e.g.

* governance meeting
* retrospectives
* daily standups 
* planning and review or coordination meeting

Often the actual facilitation is shared between several circle members.

---

## Role: S3 Facilitator (cont.)

The facilitator should make themselves familiar with the following formats:

* rounds
* proposal forming
* consent decision making
* selections to roles
* meeting evaluation
* resolving objections


---

## Artful Participation

![right,fit](img/agreements/balance.png)

**Artful participation** is the commitment of an individual to participate in a **proactive, coherent and elegant way** in all aspects of collaboration.


* makes better agreements and more effective evolution
* is an individual choice, but much more powerful when embraced by the whole team
* develops trust (being accountable is a learned skill)
* makes stronger teams (collaboration is an individual skill)
* makes happier people (culture of mutual support and close collaboration)

---

## Artful participation (cont.)

An **individual commitment** to…

* actively **keeping and following-up on all agreements** made, in the best way possible, given the circumstances
* consciously **balancing personal needs with those of a team** and the organization as a whole 
* **developing the necessary skills** to do so
* **supporting others** in doing the same 
* bringing impediments to the attention of the circle if necessary

---

### Artful Participation: Self-Assessment

* How will I support myself and others in participating more artfully? 
* Where are my interactions with others not particularly helpful or effective?
* Which are the agreements I find hard to keep or contribute to? What can I do to change that?
* What are skills that would support me in artful participation?
* What would artful participation mean in relation to...
    * ... my daily activities 
    * ...collaboration and interaction with others?
    * ...the organization? ...our customers or clients?
    * ...the wider environment?


---

## Logbook

A logbook is a (digital) system to store all information relevant for the running an organizations or circle. The logbook is accessible to all members of an organization, information is hidden only when there is a good reason to do so.

Common platforms for logbooks are Wikis (e.g. Dokuwiki or MediaWiki, Content Management Systems (e.g. Wordpress), or Google Drive, Evernote or Trello.

---

## Logbook Contents

* Organization: 
    * driver, strategy
    * organizational values
    * organizational structure
    * agreements 

* Circle: 
    * driver, strategy
    * agreements
    * role definitions and role improvement plans

---

## Logbook Contents (cont.)

* Personal logbooks
    * role descriptions
    * tasks
    * personal strategy and personal policy



---

## Role: Logbook Keeper

The logbook keeper is responsible for maintaining a circle's logbook:

* recording all relevant information and adding it to the logbook
    * all agreements, role descriptions, selections etc.
    * making sure minutes of meetings are recorded and approved by participants
* keeping the logbook is up do date
* continuously improve organization of the logbook
* making the logbook and accessible to everyone in the circle (and in the wide organization as agreed)
* tending to all technical aspects of logbook keeping

---

## Meeting Evaluation


![right,fit](img/meetings/evaluate-interactions.png)

At the end of each meeting or workshop, take the time to evaluate your interactions and learn what can be improved.

* before the closing round
* reserve 5 minutes for 1 hour, and 15 minutes for a full-day workshop
* record the results in the logbook
* proposals for improvements are implemented by facilitator and meeting host, or added to the governance backlog
* short formats: 
    * more of/less of/start/stop/keep
    * pisitive/negative/suggested improvements

---

## Meeting Evaluation: Long Format

Ask everyone in a round to briefly contribute to any or all of the following topics: 

* effectiveness
* facilitation and format
* emotional tone
* I liked... (acknowledgments and achievements)
* I wish... (growing edges and improvements)
* What if... (wild ideas and radical suggestions)




---

## Meeting Facilitation

Make sure all meetings are facilitated. Even an inexperienced facilitator makes a difference.

* prepare an agenda of topics
* select a facilitator who
    * picks an activity or format for each topic that fits the topic and the number of participants
    * holds the space, keeps the time and navigates the agenda during the meeting
    * evaluates the meeting at the end


---

## Role: Meeting Host

The meeting host is accountable for proper preparation and follow-up of meetings, workshops or other events. 

The role may be assigned temporarily (i.e. for one specific event) or permanently. e.g. for all events of one circle.

---

## Meeting Host: Responsibilities

* preparation
    - identify goals and deliverables
    - select facilitator and keeper of the minutes
    - prepare and distribute agenda and schedule
    - estimate required time
    - identify and invite participants
    - schedule the meeting/workshop
    - book location (and transportation if required)
    - set up the space, provide required materials and information
* follow-up
    - clean up location, return keys etc.
    - make sure minutes are distributed and approved
    



---

## Rounds

![right,fit](img/circle/rounds.png) 

A group facilitation technique to maintain equivalence.

1. Pick a random person to start
    * begin with a different person each time to maintain equivalence
2. Go around the circle, give everyone the chance to speak

There's  a number of ways that experienced groups can fast track certain rounds.




---


![inline,fit](img/pattern-groups/group-4.png)



---


## Patterns in this group

* Coordination Meeting
* Coordinator Role
* Daily Standup
* Planning And Review Meetings
* Prioritized Backlog
* Pull-System For Work
* Retrospective
* Visualize Work


---

## Coordination Meeting

![right,fit](img/meetings/coordination-meeting.png)

Meet on a regular basis (usually weekly) for reporting on and coordinating work.

* facilitate the meeting, use rounds instead of discussions
* Status Reports: 
    * circle metrics (if any)
    * projects and tasks
* Agenda Items: 
    * sharing of information
    * add or update tasks or projects
    * propose new or updated agreements
* if possible agenda items are compiled before the meeting (some items will come up during the status reports)


---

## Coordinator Role

^TODO: add content


---

## Daily Standup

![right,fit](img/meetings/planning-review-standup.png)

**Speed up learning and improvement.**

* ~15 min
* every day at the same time
* circle gathers around the task board
* coordination of daily work
* adaptation of existing agreements or creation of new agreements on the spot


---

## Planning And Review Meetings

![right,fit](img/meetings/planning-review-standup.png)

* planning and review happen at regular intervals (1-4 weeks)
* planning meeting: 
    - select and estimate work items for iteration
* review meeting: 
    - review finished work items
    - decide on re-work and changes for next iteration


---

## Prioritized Backlog

A prioritized backlog is an **ordered a list of all uncompleted work items**, with the **most important items on top**. 

Work items are pulled from the top whenever there's new capacity.

No two items can be of equal importance, it's 
essential to agree on priorities and make tough choices.

---

## Prioritized Backlog

* **Benefits**
    - focus in most important items
    - keep track of everything
    - just-in-time specification, reduced cost of change
    - shared understanding of priorities enables more effective collaboration
* **Implementation**
    - **analog backlog**: sticky notes on a wall, or index cards, magnets and whiteboard
    - **digital backlog**: e.g. Google Sheets, Trello

---

## Elements of a prioritized backlog 

* a **unique reference number** (or ling) for each work item
* a **title or short description**
* the **order of work items**
* **dependencies**
* **due dates** (does not apply to all items)
* (optional) a measure for **value** 
* (optional) a measure for **investment** (often an estimate of time or complexity)




---

## Pull-System For Work

* people pull in new items when they have capacity (instead of work being pushed at them)
* priorize available work items to get make sure important items get worked on first
* prevents overloading the system, especially when amount of work in progress (WIP) per person is limited 


---

## Retrospective

**Building in continuous improvement of process**

* goal: reflection on the past to guide process improvement
* output: proposals for agreements, tensions, drivers or tasks
* facilitated meeting (~1hr)
* regular intervals (1-4 weeks)
* adapt to situation and context: 
    * 5 phases with many different patterns for each phase 

---

## Retrospective: A time to reflect on process improvement ##

![inline,fit](img/meetings/retrospective.png)

---

## 5 Phases of a Retrospective Meeting ##

1. Set the Stage 
2. Gather Data
3. Generate Insights
4. Decide What to Do
5. Close the Retrospective

Activities for each phase can be found at [plans-for-retrospectives.com](http://www.plans-for-retrospectives.com/)


---

## Visualize Work

![right,fit](img/workflow-and-value/simple-process.png)

* transparency about the state of all work items currently in planning, in progress or completed.
* essential for self-organization and pull-systems
* system must be accessible to everyone affected
* **analog**: post-its on a wall, or index cards, magnets and white board
* **digital**: Google Sheets, Trello, Kanbanery, Leankit, Google Sheets, etc.

---

## Things to track: 

![right,fit](img/workflow-and-value/card.png)

* **types of work items** (e.g. customer request, project tasks, reporting tasks, rework)
* **start date** and optionally **due date**
* **priorities**
* **stages** of work (e.g. "to do", "in progress", "review" and "done")
* blocks
* who is working on which items
* agreements and expectations guiding workflow (e.g. definition of done, policy, quality standards)
* use colors, symbols, highlights etc.

![inline,fit](img/pattern-groups/group-5.png)



---

## Building Organizations

Patterns for growing an organization along the principles behind S3. 

In the addition to the patterns in this sections there's also two subsections: 

* People and Roles
* Organizational Structure.

---


## Patterns in this group

* Align Flow
* Open Systems
* Organize In Nested Domains


---

## Align Flow

![right,fit](img/workflow-and-value/types-of-flow.png)

* in an effective organization, the **flow of information and influence supports the continuous flow of value**
* alignment is achieved and maintained through continuous improvement of agreements

---

### Flow of Value ###

* flow of value is guided by agreements (explicit and implicit), and assumptions
* work in progress is considered waste as it ties up resources
* continuous flow of value prevents accumulation of waste
    * it also makes for shorter feedback loops and amplifies learning


---

## Open Systems

An organization is not a closed system, it is an open network with many connections to the "outside".

Keep the system open by adding connections as temporary or permanent members in decision making and experiments:

* external experts: benefit from outside perspective and knowledge
* representatives of affected parties: integrate existing relationships ( ➤ Those Affected Decide)



---

## Organize In Nested Domains


![right,fit](img/tension-driver-domain/nested-domains.png)

_A **domain** is an area of influence, autonomy and accountability._

Building an organization from domains defined along organizational drivers facilitates effective collaboration by creating enabling constraints and clear and logical boundaries for accountablility.


---

## Drivers Define Domains of Accountability

![right,fit](img/tension-driver-domain/driver-response-full.png)

* accountability applies to all agreements, including the organization itself, circles, and roles
* everyone's primary accountability is for effective collaboration in response to drivers
* circles are accountable their work, their body of agreements and for their own development
* everyone in an organization is accountable for upholding organizational values and principles


---


![inline,fit](img/pattern-groups/group-6.png)



---

## Roles implement functions

![inline,fit](img/people-and-roles/driver-role-selection-development.png)

---

## Performance Improvement Process ##

### Continuous improvement of the effectiveness of people in roles ###


![inline,fit](img/people-and-roles/development-process.png)




---


## Patterns in this group

* Development Plan
* Effectiveness Review
* Role
* Role Description
* Role Selection
* Support Roles


---

## Development Plan

* an agreement for developing greater effectiveness in a role
* contents:
    - current role description
    - appreciations
    - areas for improvement
    - action items to improve effectiveness
    - evaluation criteria
    - suggested amendments to role description

---

## Template for Development Plan

![inline,fit](img/people-and-roles/development-plan-template.png)



---

## Effectiveness Review

* development in roles supported by peers
* the individual holding the role initiates the process and begins each step
* harvest appreciations, identify opportunities for improvement and evolve the role

---

## Steps of an Effectiveness Review

![right,fit](img/people-and-roles/effectiveness-review.png)

1. Invite people with complementing perspectives to contribute to the review, and a facilitator
2. Collect appreciations
3. Identify areas for improvement
    * personal development
    * updates to role description, function or driver 
4. Co-create and consent to a development plan


---

## Role

![right,fit](img/people-and-roles/roles.png)

* roles are more flexible than positions
* people can wear many hats
* (s)election by consent…
* …and for a limited term
* peers support development in roles




---

## Role Description

* manage expectations for roles
* role descriptions can be created using proposal forming 
* a minimal role description contains:
    * driver
    * term
    * key responsibilities
    * time requirements
    * resources, budget, privileges
    * preferable skills, experience and qualities
    * cadence of effectiveness reviews

---

## Template for Role Descriptions

![inline,fit](img/people-and-roles/role-description-template.png)


---

## Role Selection

![right,fit](img/people-and-roles/selection.png)

* People avoid expressing interest before elections 
* Nominations are made on the strength of the reason
    * not according to the majority
* You can nominate yourself or pass
* When harvesting objections, ask the candidate last
* Objections may be resolved by amending the role description or by nominating someone else


---

## Support Roles

### Apply roles to external contractors ###
    
* identify function
* create a role description
* implement a selection process
* limit term of the contract
* initiate development process 

Support roles may be operational only, external contractors opt-in to role descriptions.


---


![inline,fit](img/pattern-groups/group-7.png)



---

## Organizational Structure ##

* enables effective collaboration
* delegates decision making power
* evolves continuously to adapt to changing environments

**Semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing circles** are the basic building blocks for organizational structure.

Circles can be linked in a hierarchy or a **heterarchy** (a.k.a. complex adaptive system, or network), where different functional structures co-exist.

---

## Structural Patterns ##

* Sociocracy 3.0 describes a variety of patterns to grow organizational structure
* patterns apply to different layers of abstraction (basic, micro, macro and meta)
* different patterns serve different drivers
* patterns can be combined as needed
* more patterns are out there and will be discovered


---


## Patterns in this group

* Backbone Organization
* Coordination Circle
* Delegate Circle
* Double Linking
* Double-Linked Hierarchy
* Fractal Organization
* Helping Circle
* Nested Circle
* Peach Organization
* Representative
* Service Circle


---

## Backbone Organization

### A pattern for multi-stakeholder projects or services.

![inline,fit](img/structural-patterns/backbone-organization.png)




---

## Coordination Circle

A coordination circle coordinates decision making and collaboration of several circles.

Coordination circles may be accountable for all aspects of collaboration, or just for a specific subset (or subdomain).


---

## Delegate Circle

### A pattern for coordination 

![inline,fit](img/structural-patterns/delegate-circle.png)


---

## Double Linking

![right,fit](img/structural-patterns/double-link.png)

### Facilitate two-way flow of information and influence

* Two interdependent circles each elect a representative to participate as full members in both circles' governance meetings
* can be used to prevent tensions in hierarchical structures


---

## Double-Linked Hierarchy

### A pattern for the early phase of a transformation

![inline,fit](img/structural-patterns/double-linked-hierarchy.png)


---

## Fractal Organization


### A Pattern for learning, coordination and alignment across organizational boundaries.

![inline,fit](img/structural-patterns/fractal-organization.png)




---

## Helping Circle

![right,fit](img/structural-patterns/helping-circle.png)

A group of people with the mandate to execute on rules and guidelines set by its parent circle.

* expands capacity of the parent circle 
* self-organizing or guided by coordinator/leader. 
* has no governance meeting
* can raise objections to rules and guidelines to parent circle.


---

## Nested Circle

### A pattern for expanding functions

![inline,fit](img/structural-patterns/nested-circle.png)




---

## Peach Organization

### Periphery drives the organization, the center provides services.

![inline,fit](img/structural-patterns/peach-organization.png)


---

## Representative

Representatives (a.k.a Links)...:

* ...stand for the interests of one circle in another circle
* ...are elected for a limited term
* ...participate as full members in governance meetings of the other circle and can:
    * raise items for the agenda
    * object to agreements and proposals



---

---

## Adopt The Seven Principles (cont.)

![right,fit](img/collaboration-values/values-step3.png)

* values embrace Sociocracy 3.0 principles
* collaboration follows principles and values
* adopt the seven principles to reduce the number of agreements necessary, and to guide adaptation of patterns


---

## Agree On Values

![right,fit](img/collaboration-values/values-step2.png)

_A **value** is a principle of some significance that guides behavior._

* In an organization people come together to collaborate
* every individual has values that are influenced by their experiences and beliefs
* values may define ethical limitations to action

--- 

## Agree On Values

* organizational values **define culture** and set parameters for action
* values offer guidance to determine appropriate action, even in the absence of explicit agreements
* a group or organization may **choose to collectively adopt values**
* defining values is a **strategy** that supports effectiveness of an organization:
    * reduces potential for **misunderstanding**
    * **aligns** decision making and action
    * **attracts new members, partners and customers** who are aligned with the organization
* values are an agreement, and thus subject to **regular reviews**




---

## Bylaws

* legal integrity
* build s3 principles and patterns into your bylaws as needed

^TODO: add content


---

## Contracting And Accountability

![right,fit](img/circle/enter-leave-circle.png)

* define the process for entering the organization
* define default role for a new member
* define the process for leaving an organization




---

## Linking

**Connecting two circles**

![inline,fit](img/structural-patterns/link.png)



---

## Transparent Salary

![right,fit](img/circle/transparent-salary.png)

* transparent salaries need to be fair
* fairness has several orthogonal dimensions    
* perception of fairness is specific to organization
* consider members and relevant stakeholders (e.g. investors)
* fixed: subsistence guarantee
* variable: fair distribution of gains and losses
* consider remuneration for changing roles
* create strategy for transitioning towards new contracts and compensation agreements

## Patterns in this group

* Adapt Patterns To Context
* Be The Change
* Continuous Improvement Of Work Process
* Open S3 Adoption
* Pull-System For Organizational Change


---

## Adapt Patterns To Context

![right,fit](img/agreements/adapt-pattern-to-context.png)

* adapting and evolving s3 patterns is a hypothesis-driven process
* **shared understanding and buy-in is essential**: make sure everyone affected by adaptation is present or represented when creating and evolving the adaptation
* make sure you understand *why* you need to adapt the pattern
* use S3 principles as guide for adaptation
* make sure experiment with adaptation runs long enough to provide enough experience
* consider feeding back successful adaptations to the S3 community



---

## Be The Change

* be the change you want to create
* tell the story how you discovered S3
* invite others for experiments
*  learn and grow (together)


---

## Continuous Improvement Of Work Process

### To reveal tensions and establish a metrics-based pull-system for organizational change. ###

* start with consent in one circle, elect a facilitator, define values, and go
* trigger continuous improvement (e.g through Kanban)
* let them pull in patterns 
* then expand the scope of the experiment

---

## Waste and Continuous Improvement ##

![right,fit](img/workflow-and-value/drivers-value-waste.png)

**Waste** _is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

* waste exist in many different forms and on different levels of abstraction (tasks, processes, organizational structure, mental models...)
* establishing a process for ongoing elimination of waste enables natural evolution of an organization towards greater effectiveness
* adaptation to changing environment is built into the process



---

## Open S3 Adoption

* install a regular cadence of Open Spaces 
    * invite all members to create and run experiments
    * set boundaries for experiments: S3 principles
    * review experiments in the next Open Space
    * repeat


---

## Pull-System For Organizational Change

* all change is voluntary
* create an environment that empowers and invites members of the organization to drive change
* bring in patterns that solve current and important problems
    * don't break what's already working
    * meet everyone where they are …
    * …and let them choose their own pace




---

# Closing 

---

## Breaking the Rules #

* is sometimes **necessary**...
* ...but may come at a **cost** to the community
* we are accountable:
    * **clean up** disturbances
    * **follow up** ASAP with those affected or accountable
    * **initiate changes** instead of breaking the rules repeatedly

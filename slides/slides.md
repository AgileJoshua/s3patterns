# Making And Evolving Agreements

^TODO: add content


---

## Agreements

![right,fit](img/tension-driver-domain/driver-agreement-improvement.png)

_An **agreement** is an agreed upon guideline, pattern, process or protocol designed to guide the flow of value._

* agreements are created in order to respond to drivers 
* agreements are the **accountability of the circle** that created them
* each agreement includes **evaluation criteria** and is subject to **regular review**

---

## Agreements

![inline,fit](img/agreements/agreement-lifecycle-long.png)

---

## Template for Agreements

![inline,fit](img/agreements/agreement-template.png)



---

## Circle

![right,fit](img/circle/circle-driver.png)  

_A **circle** is a semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing group of people gathering around a driver._

A circle...

* ...is the basic building block of an organization
* ...may be permanent or temporary
* ...makes all agreements by consent
* ...is accountable for its own development

---

## Circle

* ...**semi-autonomous**: 
    * each has a unique driver and can create value independently
* ...**self-organizing**:
    * independent in organizing day-to-day-work
* ...**self-governing**:
    * independent in creating strategy and agreements

---

## Consent Decision Making

![right,fit](img/agreements/cdm-condensed.png)

* facilitated decision making process
* collect objections from everyone affected and integrate the wisdom they contain in proposals or existing agreements
* withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization
* unresolved objections stop proposals becoming agreements
* can you *live with it* until the review? ➤ proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*
* **contract of consent**: support agreements in the absence of objections


---

## Deliverables

^TODO: add content


---

## Driver

![right,fit](img/drivers-and-subdrivers/elements-of-a-driver-alt.png)

* **shared understanding** of our motivation for action (the "why")
* describes a **specific situation**: conditions and the **needs** we associate with it
* focus on the **present**, not future or assumptions
* precedes goals, objectives, aims, mission, vision, purpose
* **incrementally refined**, easy to review 

The response to a driver is usually an experiment, that evolves over time with what is learned along the way.

---

## Review of Drivers: ###

![right,fit](img/experiments/kaizen.png)

* Is the description of the situation still correct?
* Do we still associate the same needs with the situation?
* Is the driver still within our domain?
* Is the driver still relevant?

---

### Drivers: Value and Waste ###

_**Value** is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to responding to a driver._

**Waste** _is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

Adopting the concept of value and waste makes many tools and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** available to support organizations running on Sociocracy 3.0:

* value stream mapping
* various strategies for eliminating waste
* the Kanban Method






---

## Evaluate Agreements

^TODO: add content



---

## Evaluation Criteria

^TODO: add content

![inline,fit](img/agreements/outcome-and-criteria.png)



---

## Intended Outcome

^TODO: add content

![inline,fit](img/agreements/outcome-and-criteria.png)


---

## Objections

_An **objection** is an important reason why doing what is proposed stands in the way of (more) effective response to a driver._

Objections...

* ...stop proposals from becoming agreements.
* ...contain emergent information that can be used to improve proposals and agreements
* ...reveal both opportunities or impediments


---

## Objections


It's the decision of the individual who raised the objection to stay or withdraw the objection.

Withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization

Being able to raise objections at any time means that proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*

---

## Questions to Understand Objections ##

* Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?
* Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or existing) **agreement**...

    * ...jeopardizes the response to a driver?
    * ...is in conflict with the organization's values?
    * ...prevents or diminishes someone's contribution to responding to a driver?
    * ...can be improved significantly?

---

# Concerns... #

* ...are not objections
* ...are not important enough to prevent an agreement
* ...often contain wisdom 
* ...can be recorded in the logbook
    * ...to further evolve agreements
    * ...to set evaluation criteria (including review date)


---

## Proposal Forming

![right,fit](img/agreements/proposal-forming-medium.png)

Proposal Forming...

* ...is a facilitated format for co-creating a response to a drivers
* ...is similar to condensed design thinking process
* ...taps the collective intelligence of a group
* ...involves people in co-creating agreements
* ...fosters accountability and a sense of ownership

---
  
## Proposal Forming Process ##

1. **Identify** the driver 
2. **Consider**: Collect considerations as questions that reveal the scope of the issue
3. **Create**: Gather ingredients/ideas for solutions
4. **Refine**: Design a proposal from some or all of the ingredients
5. **Review**: process with consent decision making
  



---

## Qualifying Drivers

**...in order to avoid action bias**

>_Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom._ (Viktor E. Frankl)

We consider why, how and when to respond to a stimulus, instead of defaulting to action. 

Often a tensions is **outside the domain** we can address, or not important enough to respond to.

^TODO: more content here




---

## Resolve Objections

# Methods for Resolving Objections #

* ask proposal owner
* ask member with objection to amend proposal
* facilitator amends proposal
* "How would you solve this" – round
* Brief Dialogue – 2 or 3 people
* Brief group discussion
* refer to proposal forming
* drop the proposal
* Re-work – Send back to higher / lower circle
* Form a temporary circle to review, research, revise


---

## Strategy

![right,fit](img/tension-driver-domain/domain-model.png)

_A **strategy** is the approach towards creating value within a domain._


* describes high level approach 
    * not a detailed plan or a full product description
* includes a description of the intended outcome (a.k.a. "vision")
* is regularly reviewed and updated as necessary
* helps in the decision whether to continue or change course (*pivot or persevere*)



---

## Those Affected Decide

^TODO: add content


---

# Governance

^TODO: add content


---

## Governance Backlog

^TODO: add content


---

## Governance Meeting

Circles meet at regular intervals to create and evolve agreements in response to drivers.

* usually ~60 min
* regular cadence, usually 2-4 weeks

---

## Governance Meeting Structure

* Opening Round
    * attune to one another and to the driver the circle serves
* Administrative Matters
    * consent to last minutes, dates, consent to agenda
* Agenda Items
    * Short Reports
    * Processing Tensions
    * Proposal Forming and Consent to Proposals
    * Review of Agreements, Strategy and Driver
    * Defining Roles and Selecting People for Roles
    * Consent to Role Improvement Plans
* Closing Round
    * evaluation of meeting and results, future agenda items





---

## Navigating Via Tension
  
* individuals act as sensors for the organization
* tensions arise whenever our perception of what is happening is in conflict with our **expectations** or our **values** (and principles)
* problems, challenges, and feelings of unease are all tensions
* investigating tension leads to the discovery of drivers
* to identify a possible driver behind a tension we:
    * **describe** the situation
    * **identify** the needs we associate with that reality 
* in the process, a tensions may be resolved as **misunderstandings**

---

# Effective Meetings

^TODO: add content


---

## S3 Facilitator

![right,fit](img/circle/facilitator.png)

The facilitator facilitates all meeting formats, e.g.

* proposal forming
* selections
* consent decision making
* retrospectives
* daily standups 
* ...

Often the role of the facilitator is shared between several circle members.


---

## Artful Participation

^TODO: add content

![inline,fit](img/agreements/balance.png)

---

## Logbook

A logbook is a (digital) system to store all information relevant for the running an organizations or circle. The logbook is accessible to all members of an organization, information is hidden only when there is a good reason to do so.

---

## Logbook Contents

* Organization: 
    * driver, strategy
    * organizational values
    * organizational structure
    * agreements 

* Circle: 
    * driver, strategy
    * agreements
    * role definitions and role improvement plans

---

## Logbook Contents (cont.)

* Personal logbooks
    * role descriptions
    * tasks
    * personal strategy and personal policy

---

## Rounds

![right,fit](img/circle/rounds.png) 

A group facilitation technique to maintain equivalence.

1. Pick a random person to start
    * begin with a different person each time to maintain equivalence
2. Go around the circle, give everyone the chance to speak

There's  a number of ways that experienced groups can fast track certain rounds.

# Coordinating Work

^TODO: add content


---

## Coordination Meeting

^TODO: add content


---

## Coordinator Role

^TODO: add content


---

## Daily Standup


**Speed up learning and improvement.**

* ~15 min
* every day at the same time
* circle gathers around the task board
* coordination of daily work
* adaptation of existing agreements or creation of new agreements on the spot


---

## Planning And Review Meetings

^TODO: add content


---

## Prioritized Backlog

^TODO: add content


---

## Pull-System For Work

^TODO: add content


---

## Retrospective

^TODO: clean up this section

**Reflect on a longer period of work and improve agreements.**

* ~60 min
* cadence, usually 2-4 weeks
* helps seeing the bigger picture, and identifying more complex types of waste
* What can we learn from the last iteration of work?
* Are our tools still sharp enough?
* Are we still going in the right direction?


---

## Retrospective

**Building in continuous improvement of process**

* goal: reflection on the past to guide process improvement
* output: proposals for agreements, tensions, drivers or tasks
* facilitated meeting (~1hr)
* regular intervals (1-4 weeks)
* adapt to situation and context: 
    * 5 phases with many different patterns for each phase 

---

## Retrospective: A time to reflect on process improvement ##

![inline,fit](img/meetings/retrospective.png)

---

## 5 Phases of a Retrospective Meeting ##

1. Set the Stage 
2. Gather Data
3. Generate Insights
4. Decide What to Do
5. Close the Retrospective

Activities for each phase can be found at [plans-for-retrospectives.com](http://www.plans-for-retrospectives.com/)

## Visualize Work

^TODO: add content


---

# Building Organizations

^TODO: add content



---

## Align Flow

![right,fit](img/workflow-and-value/types-of-flow.png)

* in an effective organization, the **flow of information and influence supports the continuous flow of value**
* alignment is achieved and maintained through continuous improvement of agreements

---

### Flow of Value ###

* flow of value is guided by agreements (explicit and implicit), and assumptions
* work in progress is considered waste as it ties up resources
* continuous flow of value prevents accumulation of waste
    * it also makes for shorter feedback loops and amplifies learning


---

## Open Systems

^TODO: add content



---

## Organize In Nested Domains


![right,fit](img/tension-driver-domain/nested-domains.png)

_A **domain** is an area of influence, autonomy and accountability._

Building an organization from domains defined along organizational drivers facilitates effective collaboration by creating enabling constraints and clear and logical boundaries for accountablility.


---

## Drivers Define Domains of Accountability

![right,fit](img/tension-driver-domain/simple-domain-model.png)

* accountability applies to all agreements, including the organization itself, circles, and roles
* everyone's primary accountability is for effective collaboration in response to drivers
* circles are accountable their work, their body of agreements and for their own development
* everyone in an organization is accountable for upholding organizational values and principles


---

# People And Roles

---

## Development Plan


**Contents:**

* current role description
* appreciations
* areas for improvement
* action items to improve effectiveness
* evaluation criteria
* suggested amendments to role description



---

## Effectiveness Review

* the individual holding the role initiates the process and begins each step

---

## Steps of an Effectiveness Review

![right,fit](img/people-and-roles/effectiveness-review.png)

1. Invite people with complementing perspectives to contribute to the review, and a facilitator
2. Collect appreciations
3. Identify areas for improvement
    * personal development
    * updates to role description, function or driver 
4. Co-create and consent to a development plan





---

## Role

![right,fit](img/people-and-roles/roles.png)

* roles are more flexible than positions
* people can wear many hats
* (S)election by consent…
* …and for a limited term
* peers support development in roles



---

## Role Description

* role descriptions can be created using proposal forming 
* a minimal role description contains:

    * driver
    * term
    * key responsibilities
    * preferable skills, experience and qualities
    * cadence of effectiveness reviews

---

## Template for Role Descriptions

![inline,fit](img/people-and-roles/role-description-template.png)


---

## Role Selection

![right,fit](img/people-and-roles/selection.png)

* People avoid expressing interest before elections 
* Nominations are made on the strength of the reason
    * not according to the majority
* You can nominate yourself or pass
* When harvesting objections, ask the candidate last
* Objections may be resolved by amending the role description or by nominating someone else


---

## Support Roles

^TODO: add content



---

# Organizational Structure

---

## Organizational Structure ##

* enables effective collaboration
* delegates decision making power
* evolves continuously to adapt to changing environments

**Semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing circles** are the basic building blocks for organizational structure.

Circles can be linked in a hierarchy or a **heterarchy** (a.k.a. complex adaptive system, or network), where different functional structures co-exist.

---

## Structural Patterns ##

* Sociocracy 3.0 describes a variety of patterns to grow organizational structure
* patterns apply to different layers of abstraction (basic, micro, macro and meta)
* different patterns serve different drivers
* patterns can be combined as needed
* more patterns are out there and will be discovered


---

## Backbone Organization

A pattern for multi-stakeholder projects or services.

---

## Coordination Circle

^TODO: add content


---

## Delegate Circle

![inline,fit](img/structural-patterns/delegate-circle.png)


---

## Double Linking

![right,fit](img/structural-patterns/double-link.png)

Facilitate two-way flow of information and influence

* Two interdependent circles each elect a representative to participate as full members in both circles' governance meetings
* can be used to prevent tensions in hierarchical structures


---

## Double-Linked Hierarchy

A pattern for the early phase of a transformation

![inline,fit](img/structural-patterns/peach-organization.png)


---

## Representative

Representatives (a.k.a Links)...:

* ...stand for the interests of one circle in another circle
* ...are elected for a limited term
* ...participate as full members in governance meetings of the other circle and can:
    * raise items for the agenda
    * object to agreements and proposals



---

## Service Circle


A pattern for outsourcing shared services

![inline,fit](img/structural-patterns/service-circle.png)

# Bringing In S3 Patterns

^TODO: add content


---

## Adapt Patterns To Context

^TODO: add content


---

## Be The Change

* be the change you want to create
* tell the story how you discovered S3
* invite others for experiments
*  learn and grow (together)


---

## Continuous Improvement Of Work Process

* start with consent in one circle, elect a facilitator, define values, and go
* trigger continuous improvement (e.g through Kanban)
* let them pull in patterns 
* then expand the scope of the experiment

---

## Waste and Continuous Improvement ##

![right,fit](img/workflow-and-value/drivers-value-waste.png)

**Waste** _is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

* waste exist in many different forms and on different levels of abstraction (tasks, processes, organizational structure, mental models...)
* establishing a process for ongoing elimination of waste enables natural evolution of an organization towards greater effectiveness
* adaptation to changing environment is built into the process



---

## Open S3 Adoption

* install a regular cadence of Open Spaces 
    * invite all members to create and run experiments
    * set boundaries for experiments: S3 principles
    * review experiments in the next Open Space
    * repeat


---

## Pull-System For Organizational Change

* all change is voluntary
* create an environment that empowers and invites members of the organization to drive change:
    * don't break what's already working
    * meet everyone where they are …
    * …and let them choose their own pace




---

# Alignment

^TODO: add content


---

## Adopt The Seven Principles

![inline,fit](img/general/s3-principles.png)

---

## Adopt The Seven Principles (cont.)

![right,fit](img/collaboration-values/values-step3.png)

* values embrace Sociocracy 3.0 principles
* collaboration follows principles and values
* adopt the seven principles to reduce the number of agreements necessary, and to guide adaptation of patterns


---

## Agree On Values

![right,fit](img/collaboration-values/values-step2.png)

_A **value** is a principle of some significance that guides behavior._

* In an organization people come together to collaborate
* every individual has values that are influenced by their experiences and beliefs
* values may define ethical limitations to action

--- 

## Agree On Values

* organizational values **define culture** and set parameters for action
* values offer guidance to determine appropriate action, even in the absence of explicit agreements
* a group or organization may **choose to collectively adopt values**
* defining values is a **strategy** that supports effectiveness of an organization:
    * reduces potential for **misunderstanding**
    * **aligns** decision making and action
    * **attracts new members, partners and customers** who are aligned with the organization
* values are an agreement, and thus subject to **regular reviews**




---

## Bylaws

^TODO: add content


---

## Contracting And Accountability

![right,fit](img/circle/enter-leave-circle.png)

* define the process for entering the organization
* define default role for a new member
* define the process for leaving an organization




---

## Linking

**Connecting two circles**

![inline,fit](img/structural-patterns/link.png)



---

## Transparent Salary

![right,fit](img/circle/transparent-salary.png)

* transparent salaries need to be fair
* fairness has several orthogonal dimensions    
* perception of fairness is specific to organization
* consider members and relevant stakeholders (e.g. investors)
* classic sociocracy: everyone feels gains and losses
* consider remuneration for changing roles
* create strategy for transitioning towards new contracts and compensation agreements



---

# Closing 

---

## Breaking the Rules #

* is sometimes **necessary**...
* ...but may come at a **cost** to the community
* we are accountable:
    * **clean up** disturbances
    * **follow up** ASAP with those affected or accountable
    * **initiate changes** instead of breaking the rules repeatedly

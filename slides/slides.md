# Making And Evolving Agreements

^TODO: add content


---

## Agreements

![right,fit](img/tension-driver-domain/driver-agreement-improvement.png)

_An **agreement** is an agreed upon guideline, pattern, process or protocol designed to guide the flow of value._

* agreements are created in order to respond to drivers 
* agreements are the **accountability of the circle** that created them
* each agreement includes **evaluation criteria** and is subject to **regular review**

---

## Agreements

![inline,fit](img/agreements/agreement-lifecycle-long.png)

---

## Template for Agreements

![inline,fit](img/agreements/agreement-template.png)



---

## Circle

![right,fit](img/circle/circle-driver.png)  

_A **circle** is a semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing group of people gathering around a driver._

A circle...

* ...is the basic building block of an organization
* ...may be permanent or temporary
* ...makes all agreements by consent
* ...is accountable for its own development

---

## Circle

* ...**semi-autonomous**: 
    * each has a unique driver and can create value independently
* ...**self-organizing**:
    * independent in organizing day-to-day-work
* ...**self-governing**:
    * independent in creating strategy and agreements

---

## Consent Decision Making


![right,fit](img/agreements/cdm-condensed.png)

* is a facilitated decision making process
* deliberately harvests reasoned objections in order to integrate the wisdom they contain in proposals or existing agreements
* helps balance equivalence and effectiveness
* experienced groups can move quickly through the stages of Consent Decision Making 

---

## Consent Decision Making

* Consent is the absence of (reasoned and important) objections
    * everyone affected by a decision can "live with it"
    * consent is not consensus with unanimity
* Consent can be used to make and evolve agreements in a circle
* Objections stop proposals becoming agreements
* Withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization
* Being able to raise objections at any time means that proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*
* Every agreement has a review date 




---

## Deliverables

^TODO: add content


---

## Driver

![right,fit](img/experiments/kaizen.png)

_A **driver** is the motive to respond to a specific situation._

Drivers can be understood through looking at the needs we associate with the situations, and the conditions relevant for the existence of those needs .

The response to a driver is usually an experiment, that evolves over time with what is learned along the way.


---

## Drivers Are Subject to Regular Review ##

* Is the description of the situation still correct?
* Do we still associate the same needs with the situation?
* Is the driver still within our domain?
* Is the driver still relevant?

---

### Drivers: Value and Waste ###

_**Value** is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to responding to a driver._

**Waste** _is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

Adopting the concept of value and waste makes many tools and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** available to support organizations running on Sociocracy 3.0:

* value stream mapping
* various strategies for eliminating waste
* the Kanban Method

---

## Intended Outcome

^TODO: add content

![inline,fit](img/agreements/outcome-and-criteria.png)


---

## Objections

_An **objection** is an important reason why doing what is proposed stands in the way of (more) effective response to a driver._

Objections...

* ...stop proposals from becoming agreements.
* ...contain emergent information that can be used to improve proposals and agreements
* ...reveal both opportunities or impediments


---

## Objections


It's the decision of the individual who raised the objection to stay or withdraw the objection.

Withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization

Being able to raise objections at any time means that proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*

---

## Questions to Understand Objections ##

* Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?
* Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or existing) **agreement**...

    * ...jeopardizes the response to a driver?
    * ...is in conflict with the organization's values?
    * ...prevents or diminishes someone's contribution to responding to a driver?
    * ...can be improved significantly?

---

# Concerns... #

* ...are not objections
* ...are not important enough to prevent an agreement
* ...often contain wisdom 
* ...can be recorded in the logbook
    * ...to further evolve agreements
    * ...to set evaluation criteria (including review date)

* Consent is the absence of objections
    * everyone affected by a decision can "live with it"
    * consent is not consensus with unanimity
* Consent is used to make and evolve all agreements in a circle
* Every agreement has a review date 





---

## Proposal Forming

![right,fit](img/agreements/proposal-forming-medium.png)

Proposal Forming...

* ...is a facilitated format for co-creating a response to a drivers
* ...is similar to condensed design thinking process
* ...taps the collective intelligence of a group
* ...involves people in co-creating agreements
* ...fosters accountability and a sense of ownership

---
  
## Proposal Forming Process ##

1. **Identify** the driver 
2. **Consider**: Collect considerations as questions that reveal the scope of the issue
3. **Create**: Gather ingredients/ideas for solutions
4. **Refine**: Design a proposal from some or all of the ingredients
5. **Review**: process with consent decision making
  



---

## Qualifying Drivers

**...in order to avoid action bias**

>_Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom._ (Viktor E. Frankl)

We consider why, how and when to respond to a stimulus, instead of defaulting to action. 

Often a tensions is **outside the domain** we can address, or not important enough to respond to.

---

## Resolve Objections

# Methods for Resolving Objections #

* ask proposal owner
* ask member with objection to amend proposal
* facilitator amends proposal
* "How would you solve this" – round
* Brief Dialogue – 2 or 3 people
* Brief group discussion
* refer to proposal forming
* drop the proposal
* Re-work – Send back to higher / lower circle
* Form a temporary circle to review, research, revise

## Governance Meeting

Circles meet at regular intervals to create and evolve agreements in response to drivers.

* usually ~60 min
* regular cadence, usually 2-4 weeks

---

## Governance Meeting Structure

* Opening Round
    * attune to one another and to the driver the circle serves
* Administrative Matters
    * consent to last minutes, dates, consent to agenda
* Agenda Items
    * Short Reports
    * Processing Tensions
    * Proposal Forming and Consent to Proposals
    * Review of Agreements, Strategy and Driver
    * Defining Roles and Selecting People for Roles
    * Consent to Role Improvement Plans
* Closing Round
    * evaluation of meeting and results, future agenda items





---

## Navigating Via Tension
  
* individuals act as sensors for the organization
* tensions arise whenever our perception of what is happening is in conflict with our **expectations** or our **values** (and principles)
* problems, challenges, and feelings of unease are all tensions
* investigating tension leads to the discovery of drivers
* to identify a possible driver behind a tension we:
    * **describe** the situation
    * **identify** the needs we associate with that reality 
* in the process, a tensions may be resolved as **misunderstandings**

## S3 Facilitator

![right](img/circle/facilitator.png)

The facilitator facilitates all meeting formats, e.g.

* proposal forming
* selections
* consent decision making
* retrospectives
* daily standups 
* ...

Often the role of the facilitator is shared between several circle members.

## Artful Participation

^TODO: add content

![inline,fit](img/agreements/balance.png)

---

## Logbook

A logbook is a (digital) system to store all information relevant for the running an organizations or circle. The logbook is accessible to all members of an organization, information is hidden only when there is a good reason to do so.

---

## Logbook Contents

* Organization: 
    * driver, strategy
    * organizational values
    * organizational structure
    * agreements 

* Circle: 
    * driver, strategy
    * agreements
    * role definitions and role improvement plans

---

## Logbook Contents (cont.)

* Personal logbooks
    * role descriptions
    * tasks
    * personal strategy and personal policy

## Rounds

![right](img/circle/rounds.png) 

A group facilitation technique to maintain equivalence.

1. Pick a random person to start
    * begin with a different person each time to maintain equivalence
2. Go around the circle, give everyone the chance to speak

There's  a number of ways that experienced groups can fast track certain rounds.

* ~60 min
* cadence, usually 2-4 weeks
* helps seeing the bigger picture, and identifying more complex types of waste
* What can we learn from the last iteration of work?
* Are our tools still sharp enough?
* Are we still going in the right direction?


---

## Retrospective

**Building in continuous improvement of process**

* goal: reflection on the past to guide process improvement
* output: proposals for agreements, tensions, drivers or tasks
* facilitated meeting (~1hr)
* regular intervals (1-4 weeks)
* adapt to situation and context: 
    * 5 phases with many different patterns for each phase 

---

## Retrospective: A time to reflect on process improvement ##

![inline,fit](img/meetings/retrospective.png)

---

## 5 Phases of a Retrospective Meeting ##

1. Set the Stage 
2. Gather Data
3. Generate Insights
4. Decide What to Do
5. Close the Retrospective

## Align Flow

![right,fit](img/workflow-and-value/types-of-flow.png)

* in an effective organization, the **flow of information and influence supports the continuous flow of value**
* alignment is achieved and maintained through continuous improvement of agreements

---

### Flow of Value ###

* flow of value is guided by agreements (explicit and implicit), and assumptions
* work in progress is considered waste as it ties up resources
* continuous flow of value prevents accumulation of waste
    * it also makes for shorter feedback loops and amplifies learning

## Development Plan


**Contents:**

* current role description
* appreciations
* areas for improvement
* action items to improve effectiveness
* evaluation criteria
* suggested amendments to role description



---

## Effectiveness Review

* a process to harvest appreciations, identify opportunities for improvement and evolve the role
* the individual holding the role initiates the process and begins each step

---

## Steps of an Effectiveness Review

![right,fit](img/people-and-roles/effectiveness-review.png)

1. Invite people with complementing perspectives to contribute to the review, and a facilitator
2. Collect appreciations
3. Identify areas for improvement
    * personal development
    * updates to role description, function or driver 
4. Co-create and consent to a development plan





---

## Role

^TODO: add content



---

## Role Description

* role descriptions can be created using proposal forming 
* a minimal role description contains:

    * driver
    * term
    * key responsibilities
    * preferable skills, experience and qualities
    * cadence of effectiveness reviews

---

## Template for Role Descriptions

![inline,fit](img/people-and-roles/role-description-template.png)


---

## Role Selection

![right,fit](img/people-and-roles/selection.png)

* People avoid expressing interest before elections 
* Nominations are made on the strength of the reason
    * not according to the majority
* You can nominate yourself or pass
* When harvesting objections, ask the candidate last
* Objections may be resolved by amending the role description or by nominating someone else


---

## Support Roles

# Organizational Structure


The primary function of organizational structure is **to enable effective collaboration** by aligning the flow of information to  support the flow of value..  

**Organizational structure needs to evolve continuously** in order to adapt to a changing environment.

**Semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing circles** are the basic building blocks for organizational structure.

---

## Structural Patterns ##

* Sociocracy 3.0 describes a variety of patterns to grow organizational structure
* patterns apply to different layers of abstraction (basic, micro, macro and meta)
* different patterns serve different drivers
* patterns can be combined as needed
* more patterns are out there and will be discovered

## Continuous Improvement Of Work Process

### Waste and Continuous Improvement ###

**Waste** _is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

* Establishing a process for ongoing elimination of waste enables natural evolution of an organization towards greater effectiveness
* Adaptation to changing environment is built into the process

---

### Identifying Waste ###

![inline,fit](img/workflow-and-value/drivers-value-waste.png)

* waste exist in many different forms and on different levels of abstraction
    * tasks, processes, organizational structure, mental models...
* some tensions reveal waste
* learning to identify waste is a journey
    * along the way we also learn how to evolve our drivers

## Adopt The Seven Principles

![inline,fit](img/general/s3-principles.png)

---

## Adopt The Seven Principles (cont.)

![right,fit](img/collaboration-values/values-step3.png)

* values embrace Sociocracy 3.0 principles
* collaboration follows principles and values
* adopt the seven principles to reduce the number of agreements necessary, and to guide adaptation of patterns


---

## Agree On Values

![right,fit](img/collaboration-values/values-step2.png)

_A **value** is a principle of some significance that guides behavior._

* In an organization people come together to collaborate
* every individual has values that are influenced by their experiences and beliefs
* values may define ethical limitations to action

--- 

## Agree On Values

* organizational values **define culture** and set parameters for action
* values offer guidance to determine appropriate action, even in the absence of explicit agreements
* a group or organization may **choose to collectively adopt values**
* defining values is a **strategy** that supports effectiveness of an organization:
    * reduces potential for **misunderstanding**
    * **aligns** decision making and action
    * **attracts new members, partners and customers** who are aligned with the organization
* values are an agreement, and thus subject to **regular reviews**




---

## Bylaws

^TODO: add content


---

## Contracting And Accountability

![right,fit](img/circle/enter-leave-circle.png)

* define the process for entering the organization
* define default role for a new member

---

## Linking

**Connecting two circles**

![inline,fit](img/structural-patterns/link.png)



---

## Transparent Salary

![right](img/circle/transparent-salary.png)

* transparent salaries need to be fair
* fairness has several orthogonal dimensions    
* perception of fairness is specific to organization
* consider members and relevant stakeholders (e.g. investors)
* classic sociocracy: everyone feels gains and losses
* consider remuneration for changing roles
* create strategy for transitioning towards new contracts and compensation agreements

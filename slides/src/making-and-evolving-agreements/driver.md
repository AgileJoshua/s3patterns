![right,fit](img/experiments/kaizen.png)

_A **driver** is the motive to respond to a specific situation._

Drivers can be understood through looking at the needs we associate with the situations, and the conditions relevant for the existence of those needs .

The response to a driver is usually an experiment, that evolves over time with what is learned along the way.

## Drivers Are Subject to Regular Review ##

* Is the description of the situation still correct?
* Do we still associate the same needs with the situation?
* Is the driver still within our domain?
* Is the driver still relevant?

### Drivers: Value and Waste ###

_**Value** is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to responding to a driver._

**Waste** _is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

Adopting the concept of value and waste makes many tools and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** available to support organizations running on Sociocracy 3.0:

* value stream mapping
* various strategies for eliminating waste
* the Kanban Method

## Objections

_An **objection** is an importan reason why doing what is proposed stands in the way of (more) effective response toan existing driver._

In sociocracy we deliberately seek objections as they potentially reveal information that can be used to improve proposals and agreements.

Objections...

* ...reveal wisdom seeking expression into the consciousness of a circle
* ...reveal opportunities or impediments
* ...emerge through individuals and belong to the whole circle

## Questions That Help to Validate Objections ##

* Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?
* Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or existing) **agreement**...

    * ...jeopardizes the response to a driver?
    * ...is in conflict with the organization's values?
    * ...prevents or diminishes someone's contribution to responding to a driver?
    * ...can be improved significantly?

# Concerns... #

* ...are not objections
* ...are not important enough to prevent an agreement
* ...often contain wisdom 
* ...can be recorded in the logbook
    * ...to further evolve agreements
    * ...to set evaluation criteria (including review date)

![right,fit](img/meetings/evaluate-interactions.png)

At the end of each meeting or workshop, take the time to evaluate your interactions and learn what can be improved.

* before the closing round
* reserve 5 minutes for 1 hour, and 15 minutes for a full-day workshop
* ask participants about: achievements, facilitation, emotional tone, appreciations and improvements
* record answers on a flip chart (leave more space for achievements and improvements) and later in the logbook
* proposals for improvements are implemented by facilitator and meeting host, or added to the governance backlog

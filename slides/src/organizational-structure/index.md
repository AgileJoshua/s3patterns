# Organizational Structure


The primary function of organizational structure is **to enable effective collaboration** by aligning the flow of information to  support the flow of value..  

**Organizational structure needs to evolve continuously** in order to adapt to a changing environment.

**Semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing circles** are the basic building blocks for organizational structure.

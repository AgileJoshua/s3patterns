_An **agreement** is an agreed upon guideline, pattern, process or protocol designed to guide the flow of value._

* agreements are created in order to respond to drivers
* agreements are the **accountability of the circle** that created them
* each agreement includes **evaluation criteria** and is subject to **regular review**

_A **circle** is a semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing group of people gathering around a driver._

A circle...

* ...is the basic building block of an organization
* ...may be permanent or temporary
* ...makes all agreements by consent

* **shared understanding** of our motivation for action (the "why")

* focus on the **present**, not future or assumptions
* precedes goals, objectives, aims, mission, vision, purpose

The response to a driver is usually an experiment, that evolves over time with what is learned along the way.

#### Drivers: Value and Waste ####

_**Value** is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to responding to a driver._

**Waste** _is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

Adopting the concept of value and waste makes many tools and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** available to support organizations running on Sociocracy 3.0:

* value stream mapping
* various strategies for eliminating waste
* the Kanban Method

_An **objection** is an important reason why doing what is proposed stands in the way of (more) effective response to a driver._

Objections...

* ...stop proposals from becoming agreements.
* ...contain emergent information that can be used to improve proposals and agreements
* ...reveal both opportunities or impediments

    
    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Objections

It's the decision of the individual who raised the objection to stay or withdraw the objection.

Withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization

Being able to raise objections at any time means that proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*

    
    </script>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Questions to Understand Objections ###

* Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?
* Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or existing) **agreement**...

    * ...jeopardizes the response to a driver?
    * ...is in conflict with the organization's values?

Proposal Forming...

* ...involves people in co-creating agreements
* ...fosters accountability and a sense of ownership

### Proposal Forming Process ###

1. **Identify** the driver
2. **Consider**: Collect considerations as questions that reveal the scope of the issue
3. **Create**: Gather ingredients/ideas for solutions
4. **Refine**: Design a proposal from some or all of the ingredients
5. **Review**: process with consent decision making

**...in order to avoid action bias**

>_Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom._ (Viktor E. Frankl)

We consider why, how and when to respond to a stimulus, instead of defaulting to action.

Often a tensions is **outside the domain** we can address, or not important enough to respond to.

* refer to proposal forming

<img class="float-right" src="img/tension-driver-domain/domain-model.png" width="50%" />

_A **strategy** is the approach towards creating value within a domain._

<img class="float-right" src="img/circle/transparent-salary.png" width="50%" />

* transparent salaries need to be fair
* fairness has several orthogonal dimensions
* perception of fairness is specific to organization
* consider members and relevant stakeholders (e.g. investors)
* classic sociocracy: everyone feels gains and losses
* consider remuneration for changing roles
* create strategy for transitioning towards new contracts and compensation agreements

### Waste and Continuous Improvement ###

<img class="float-right" src="img/workflow-and-value/drivers-value-waste.png" width="50%" />

**Waste** _is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

* waste exist in many different forms and on different levels of abstraction (tasks, processes, organizational structure, mental models...)
* establishing a process for ongoing elimination of waste enables natural evolution of an organization towards greater effectiveness
* adaptation to changing environment is built into the process
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Open S3 Adoption

* install a regular cadence of Open Spaces
    * invite all members to create and run experiments
    * set boundaries for experiments: S3 principles
    * review experiments in the next Open Space
    * repeat
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Pull-System For Organizational Change

* all change is voluntary
* create an environment that empowers and invites members of the organization to drive change
* bring in patterns that solve current and important problems
    * don't break what's already working
    * meet everyone where they are …
    * …and let them choose their own pace

### Breaking the Rules ##

* is sometimes **necessary**...
* ...but may come at a **cost** to the community
* we are accountable:
    * **clean up** disturbances
    * **follow up** ASAP with those affected or accountable
    * **initiate changes** instead of breaking the rules repeatedly

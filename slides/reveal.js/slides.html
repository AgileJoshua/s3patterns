<img class="float-right" src="img/tension-driver-domain/driver-agreement-improvement.png" width="50%" />

_An **agreement** is an agreed upon guideline, pattern, process or protocol designed to guide the flow of value._

* agreements are created in order to respond to drivers
* agreements are the **accountability of the circle** that created them
* each agreement includes **evaluation criteria** and is subject to **regular review**

_A **circle** is a semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing group of people gathering around a driver._

A circle...

* ...is the basic building block of an organization
* ...may be permanent or temporary
* ...makes all agreements by consent
* ...is accountable for its own development

### Consent Decision Making

* Consent is the absence of (reasoned and important) objections

    * consent is not consensus with unanimity
* Consent can be used to make and evolve agreements in a circle
* Objections stop proposals becoming agreements

* Being able to raise objections at any time means that proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*

<img class="float-right" src="img/experiments/kaizen.png" width="50%" />

_A **driver** is the motive to respond to a specific situation._

Drivers can be understood through looking at the needs we associate with the situations, and the conditions relevant for the existence of those needs .

The response to a driver is usually an experiment, that evolves over time with what is learned along the way.

    
    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Drivers Are Subject to Regular Review ###

* Is the description of the situation still correct?
* Do we still associate the same needs with the situation?
* Is the driver still within our domain?
* Is the driver still relevant?

#### Drivers: Value and Waste ####

_**Value** is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to responding to a driver._

**Waste** _is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

Adopting the concept of value and waste makes many tools and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** available to support organizations running on Sociocracy 3.0:

* value stream mapping
* various strategies for eliminating waste
* the Kanban Method

_An **objection** is an important reason why doing what is proposed stands in the way of (more) effective response to a driver._

Objections...

* ...stop proposals from becoming agreements.
* ...contain emergent information that can be used to improve proposals and agreements
* ...reveal both opportunities or impediments

    
    </script>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Objections

It's the decision of the individual who raised the objection to stay or withdraw the objection.

Withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization

Being able to raise objections at any time means that proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*

    
    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Questions to Understand Objections ###

* Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?
* Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or existing) **agreement**...

    * ...jeopardizes the response to a driver?
    * ...is in conflict with the organization's values?
    * ...prevents or diminishes someone's contribution to responding to a driver?

* ...are not objections
* ...are not important enough to prevent an agreement

Proposal Forming...

* ...is a facilitated format for co-creating a response to a drivers
* ...is similar to condensed design thinking process
* ...taps the collective intelligence of a group
* ...involves people in co-creating agreements
* ...fosters accountability and a sense of ownership

    
    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Proposal Forming Process ###

1. **Identify** the driver
2. **Consider**: Collect considerations as questions that reveal the scope of the issue
3. **Create**: Gather ingredients/ideas for solutions
4. **Refine**: Design a proposal from some or all of the ingredients
5. **Review**: process with consent decision making
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Qualifying Drivers

**...in order to avoid action bias**

>_Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom._ (Viktor E. Frankl)

We consider why, how and when to respond to a stimulus, instead of defaulting to action.

Often a tensions is **outside the domain** we can address, or not important enough to respond to.

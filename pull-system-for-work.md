title: Pull-System For Work
---


In a pull-system, people or circles pull in new work when they find they have capacity. The opposite would be a push-system, where work items are assigned from a third party. 

A pull-system will shift from optimization of capacity - which makes an organization vulnerable to the effects of unforeseen circumstances - towards optimization for throughput, building resilience and organizational agility.

A pull system fosters self-organization, because those who do the work make the call when to build the fence and when to chase the cattle. Since the system is no longer optimized for running on full capacity, people are free to use the now available "slack time" for investments in infrastructure, evolution of work processes, and building new skills. 


## Creating a Pull-System ##

In order to create a pull-system, both trust and transparency are necessary to empower everyone to be able to contribute effectively. This does not only affect those doing the actual work, who now need access to all information they need to make the right choices when pulling in work, but also "external" stakeholders or customers, who now, instead of pushing work items, need to learn a different way of communicating their requirements, and who might also need transparency about the state of work items and projects. 

S3 contains many patterns to help with that, here's a selection:

* [Those Affected Decide](those-affected-decide.html) to hand over responsibility for work process to the ones doing the work
* [Consent Decision Making](consent-decision-making.html) and [Proposal Forming](proposal-forming.html): to use all information available for effectively creating and evolving the agreements which guide pulling in work, such as priorities, plans, contracts etc.
* [Visualize Work](visualize-work.html) makes available the information what needs to be done and what is the current state of work
* in the [Daily Standup](daily-standup.html), a team or circle can collaborate on pulling in work
* a [Prioritized Backlog](prioritized-backlog.html) makes the choice about which work items to pull in much easier, as do [Planning and Review Meetings](planning-and-review-meetings.html)


## Limitations ##

In a low-trust environment, it will be difficult to establish a pull system, as a pull-system requires trust, first in the ability of people to pull in work items appropriate to the context at hand, and second in the ability and willingness of people to use slack time productively, to the benefit of the organization. What is often overlooked is that also the people need to build trust that a pull-system is not merely a new way for setting up competition. 

In these circumstances, trust can be built through first implementing the patterns [Those Affected Decide](those-affected-decide.html), which brings those who used to push work together with those who now will pull, and learn to understand each other's perspective while creating agreements as peers. This is best done in combination with [Proposal Forming](proposal-forming.html) and [Consent Decision Making](consent-decision-making.html).

title: Navigation Backlog
---


The Navigation Backlog is the place where agenda items for the Navigation meeting are collected and prioritized. It is accessible for everyone in the circle, and members can highlight items to be included in the next Navigation Meeting. The final agenda is agreed upon at the beginning of the meeting.

The backlog can easily be maintained on a wall with sticky notes, or in digital tools like Google Spreadsheets, Trello, task managers for teams or agile backlog apps.

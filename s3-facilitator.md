The facilitator supports the circle in developing their interactions and is responsible for making sure all meetings and workshops are facilitated and evaluated, e.g.

* governance meeting
* retrospectives
* daily standups 
* planning and review or coordination meeting

Often the actual facilitation is shared between several circle members.

title: Deliverables
---


A **deliverable** is something which is provided as a result of an agreement, usually framed as a product or a service. Deliverables can be defined for organizational strategy, circle strategy, [Development Plans](development-plan.html), [Role Descriptions](role-description.html), or any other [Agreement](agreements.html).

Since a deliverable is part of an agreement, make sure the amount of detail is reasonable - sufficient to allow for  shared understanding, but not too much. Consider the context in which and by whom this description will be referred to. Think about the significance of the deliverable, and how long this description needs to be referred to.

 For example simple task which will be implemented in the next week needs less written detail than continuously reviewing updates for a large product for compliance with several complicated national standards. 
 
Reference other documents when helpful or necessary, e.g. contracts, previous projects, specifications, drafts, or other agreements.

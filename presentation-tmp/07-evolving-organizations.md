# Evolution #
## Drivers for evolution ##

* become more effective as an organization
* transition to Sociocracy 3.0
* ongoing adaptation to changing environments

**Sociocracy 3.0 has one simple and iterative change method for all three.**

---

# Sociocracy 3.0 and Lean Thinking #

Adopting the concept of value and waste makes many tools and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** available to support organizations running on Sociocracy 3.0:

* value stream mapping
* various strategies for eliminating waste
* the Kanban Method

---

# Waste and Continuous Improvement

**Definition:** _Waste is anything not necessary (essential) for - or standing in the way of - effective satisfaction of a driver._

* Establishing a process for ongoing elimination of waste enables  natural evolution of an organization towards greater effectiveness
* Adaptation to changing environment is built into the process

---

# Identifying Waste #

![inline,fit](img/evolution/drivers-value-waste.png)

---

# Identifying Waste #

* waste exist in many different forms and on different levels of abstraction
	* tasks, processes, organizational structure, mental models...
* some tensions reveal waste
* learning to identify waste is a journey
	* along the way we also learn how to evolve our drivers

---

# Flow of Value (end-to-end)#

![inline,fit](img/evolution/wip-and-value.png)


---

# Flow of Value #

* flow of value is guided by policies (explicit and implicit), and assumptions
* work in progress is considered waste as it ties up resources
* continuous flow of value prevents accumulation of waste
	* it also makes for shorter feedback loops and amplifies learning

---

# Flow of Value and Flow of Information #

![inline,fit](img/evolution/types-of-flow.png)

---

# Flow of Value and Flow of Information #

* in an effective organization, the **flow of information and influence supports the continuous flow of value**
* alignment is achieved and maintained through continuous improvement of policies

---

# Evolution - How? #

* start where you are
* progressively eliminate waste
* amplify learning to speed up evolution
* Sociocracy 3.0 uses _The Kanban Method_ for evolution (and also for transitioning an organization to Sociocracy 3.0)

---

# The Kanban Method - Overview #

* based on lean ideas, formulated by David J. Anderson 
* is a change method to optimize the flow of value
* starts with current policies: work process, roles, responsibilities and titles
* is focused on incremental, evolutionary change
* relies on consent (or consensus) for creating and changing policy

---

# The Kanban Method - Overview #

* creates a pull system
* empowers close collaboration and distributed leadership in circles
* facilitates cross-functional teams

---

# The Kanban Method - Steps #

Usually Kanban is implemented in 5 steps:

1. visualize workflow
2. limit work in progress (WIP)
3. measure and manage flow
4. make process Policies explicit
5. collaborate on continuous improvement

---

# Step 1 - Visualize Workflow #
## A  Simple Workflow##

---

# Step 1 - Visualize workflow

* create a kanban board with columns for each step in the workflow
* use index cards of sticky notes to represent work items or tasks
* visualize classes of service, and who is currently working on which item(s)
* mark blocked cards

---

# Step 2 - Limit Work in Progress #

---

# Step 2 - Limit Work in Progress #

* treat work in progress (WIP) as liability, not as an asset
	* you want to get things done, not start things
* limiting WIP reduces cycle time: 
	* Average Cycle Time = Work in Progress / Throughput (Little's Law)
* limiting WIP reduces overload, fosters collaboration and supports self-organization

---

# Step 2 - Limit Work in Progress #

* limit WIP per column, per lane, per person etc.
* create policies for each limit, and visualize on the board
* limits will evolve over time, when in doubt, start with "5"

---

# Step 3 - Measure and Manage Flow #

* cycle-time: time a work item spent in the system
	* note start and end date on card
* number of blocked items, average block time
	* mark blocks on cards and block date
* defects/rework
* create a cumulative flow diagram

# Step 3 - Measure and Manage Flow #

![inline,fit](img/evolution/cfd.jpg)

---

# Step 3 - Measure and Manage Flow #

* data is easy to track (once per day is enough)
* make data  visible next to the board
* use data to identify issues, for managing flow and to create and evolve policies

---

# Step 4 - Make Policies Explicit #

* to optimize flow of value, we need a shared understanding of policy
	* everyone needs to become an expert in policy
* track all policies (and their history) in a logbook
* make policies relating to the task board visible on or next to the boards
* convert implicit policy or shared assumptions into explicit policy

---

# Step 5 - Collaborate on Continuous Improvement #

* develop shared understanding of work process and relevant models and theories in order to collectively identify opportunities for improvement
* co-create new policy to improve flow of value
* use measurements to prove effectiveness of policy

---

# How to Start #

* start with one circle
* consent to using consent (and consent decision making) for creating and changing policy
* consent to using the Kanban Method
* start with visualizing the workflow and go from there
* when starting, a driver is nice to have, but not essential
	* Kanban facilitates discovery (and refining) of drivers

---

# Next Steps 

* discover and refine drivers
* apply Sociocracy 3.0 principles and patterns to help with optimizing flow of value
* spread to other circles

---

# Scaling Kanban #

---

# Amplify Learning #

**A circle translates learning about work into policy change to optimize flow of value.**

* Daily Standup Meeting
* Improvement Meetings
* Retrospectives
* Governance Meetings

---
  
# Daily Standup #

**Speed up learning and improvement.**

* ~15 min
* every day at the same time
* circle gathers around the task board
* coordination of daily work
* adaptation of policy or creation of new policy on the spot

---

# Improvement Meeting #

**For cracking tougher nuts.**

* length as scheduled
* often scheduled in the daily standup, or even spontaneous
* focused on creating a solution for a specific topic or impediment

--- 

# Retrospective #

**Reflect on a longer period of work and improve policy.**

* ~60 min
* cadence, usually 2-4 weeks
* helps seeing the bigger picture, and identifying more complex types of waste

---

# Retrospective (2) #

* What can we learn from the last iteration of work?
* Are our tools still sharp enough?
* Are we still going in the right direction?

---

# Governance Meeting #

**Make sure nothing slips through the cracks.**

* usually ~60 min
* regular cadence, usually 2-4 weeks
* administrative matters
* scheduled review of policies
* consent to development plans

	* adaptation  or creation of a role
	* creation of a new circle
		* driver review is delegated to new circle

## Processing Tensions ##

** ...in order to avoid action bias**

>_Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom._ (Viktor E. Frankl)

We consider why, how and when to respond to a stimulus, instead of defaulting to action.

# Breaking the Rules #

* is sometimes **necessary**...
* ...but may come at a **cost** to the community
* we are accountable:
	* **clean up** disturbances
	* **follow up** ASAP with those affected or accountable
	* **initiate changes** instead of breaking the rules repeatedly

# Continuous Improvement #
## Drivers Are Subject to Regular Review ##

* Is the description of the current reality correct?
* Do we still associate the same needs with the current reality?
* Is the driver still within our domain?
* Is the driver still relevant?

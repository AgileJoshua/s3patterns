# The Life-Cycle of a Policy #

![](img/policy/policy-lifecycle.png)

---

# Responses to a Driver #

* response to a driver always involves the **adaptation of an existing policy, or creation of a new one**, including:
	* changing the plan: adding a task or project
	* adaptation  or creation of a role
	* creation of a new circle
		* driver review is delegated to new circle

---

# Proposal Forming Process #
### Co-Creating a Response to a Drivers ###

![](img/proposal-forming/proposal-forming.png)

---
  
# Proposal Forming #

1. **Identify** the driver 
2. **Consider**: Collect considerations as questions that reveal the scope of the issue
3. **Create**: Gather ingredients/ideas for solutions
4. **Refine**: Design a proposal from some or all of the ingredients
5. **Review**: process with consent decision making
  
---
  
# Proposal Forming... #

* ...is a condensed design thinking process
* ...taps the collective intelligence of a group
* ...involves people in co-creating policy
* ...fosters accountability and a sense of ownership

---

# Policy Template #

* title
* driver: current reality and needs
* intended outcome
* review date
* policy description
* evaluation criteria
* history and references (e.g. iterations, proposal forming)

---

# Example Policy #
## Product development lead times optimization.##

*  **Driver:** Current lead times hinder us from reaching market windows / Increase product development process efficiency
* **Intended Outcome:** Product development lead times maximum of 3 months
 * **Review Date:** 6 months
 * **Text:** Maximum number of ongoing parallel projects are two
 * **Evaluation Criteria:**  Lead time data from inception to  release

---

# Tensions #

**Definition**:  _A tension is the subjective experience of contradiction between reality and that which we desire or anticipate._

![](img/tension-driver-domain/tension-response.png)

---

## Tensions ##

* individuals act as sensors (nerve endings) for the organization
* tension is experienced whenever our perception of our environment is in conflict with:
	* that which we desire or had anticipated
	* our values (and principles)
* problems, challenges, and feelings of unease are all tensions

---

## Processing Tensions ##

** ...in order to avoid action bias**

>_Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom._ (Viktor E. Frankl)

We consider why, how and when to respond to a stimulus, instead of defaulting to action.

## Processing Tensions ##

## Processing Tensions ##

![](img/tension-driver-domain/processing-tensions-extended.png)

---

## From Tension to Driver ##
  
* investigating tension leads to the discovery of drivers
* to identify a possible driver behind a tension we:
	* **describe** the current reality
	* **identify** the needs we associate with that reality 
* in the process, we resolve some tensions as **misunderstandings**
* we validate drivers
	* some tensions are **outside the domain** we can address 

---

# Breaking the Rules #

* is sometimes **necessary**...
* ...but may come at a **cost** to the community
* we are accountable:
	* **clean up** disturbances
	* **follow up** ASAP with those affected or accountable
	* **initiate changes** instead of breaking the rules repeatedly

---
  
# Continuous Improvement #
## Drivers Are Subject to Regular Review ##

* Is the description of the current reality correct?
* Do we still associate the same needs with the current reality?
* Is the driver still within our domain?
* Is the driver still relevant?

# Continuous Improvement #

![](img/policy/plan-do-review.png)

---

# Governance Meetings #

* **Governance** (from Latin *gubernare* - to steer a vessel) is the process of creating and evolving policy
* Circles meet at regular intervals to govern themselves

---

# Governance Meetings #

* Opening Round
* Administrative Matters
* Agenda Items
* Closing Round

---

# Governance Meetings #

* Opening Round
	* attune to one another and to the driver the circle serves
* Administrative Matters
	* consent to last minutes, dates, consent to agenda

---

# Governance Meetings #

* Agenda Items
	* Short Reports
	* Processing Tensions
	* Proposal Forming and Consent to Proposals
	* Review of Policies, Strategy and Driver
	* Defining Roles and Selecting People for Roles
	* Consent to Role Improvement Plans

---

# Governance Meetings #

* Closing Round
	* evaluation of meeting and results, future agenda items

---

# Retrospective #
## Building in continuous improvement of process ##

* goal: reflection on the past to guide process improvement
* output: policy proposals, tensions, drivers or tasks
* facilitated meeting (~1hr)
* regular intervals (1-4 weeks)
* adapt to situation and context: 
	* 5 phases with many different patterns for each phase 

---

# Retrospective #
## A time to reflect on process improvement ##

# 5 Phases of a Retrospective Meeting #

1. Set the Stage 
2. Gather Data
3. Generate Insights
4. Decide What to Do
5. Close the Retrospective

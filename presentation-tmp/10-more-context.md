# What About Management ? ##

Management as "the process or practice of managing" is no longer a specific role but becomes a  distributed function.

In a transition period, management roles may still be present, but will most likely gradually decrease in scope the more an organization's member engage with sociocracy. 

The ones in management roles will gradually transfer relevant skills to the others, while at the same time they're picking up operational skills from the others.

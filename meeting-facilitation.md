title: Meeting Facilitation
---



When we meet, we want to develop shared understanding, exchange information, learn, and co-create responses to the driver of the meeting. Facilitation keeps meetings and workshops crisp, joyful and effective by

* giving everyone a voice and thus enabling different perspectives
* selecting activities to support the development of shared understanding, learning, and solutions
* supporting the group by mirroring and visualizing what is happening
* helping the group navigate the agenda in the time available

As a facilitator, you would:

* prepare for the meeting
	* prepare room and materials
	* design the workshop, select activities and interactions for the different phases of the workshop:
		* opening the workshop, ground rules
		* understand driver/intended outcome
		* activities to generate insight and develop shared understanding
		* selecting what topics to work on
		* make decisions / action planning
		* evaluate the outcome and learn for the next workshop
		* closing
* during the workshop
	* time-box workshop and each activity
	* document process and results in real time
	* navigate the workshop
* after the workshop 
	* take photographs of all the artifacts created and share with the group

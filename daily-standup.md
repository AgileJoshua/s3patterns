A pattern for enabling self-organization.

**Motivation for this pattern:** Teams need to coordinate work, identify impediments and opportunities, and adapt processes according to changing context.

The **daily standup** is a short, daily meeting where a team coordinates daily work and identifies impediments and opportunities to improve their work process.

## The details

For the daily standup, the team gathers around a task board every day at the same time, and makes decisions about how to move forward with their work items.

It's helpful to appoint a facilitator to keep the meeting on task and within time (if possible under 15 minutes).

The facilitator facilitates quick decisions on the spot and identifies discussions and decisions requiring more time, to be scheduled after the standup, or added to a backlog to process later.

Daily standups enable teams to

* make quick decisions about work using the knowledge of the whole team
* rapidly identify impediments and respond as needed
* accelerate learning
* improve their work processes as required

There are two common patterns for daily standups, one is **value focussed**, the other one is **people-focused**.


### Value-focused standup

The *value-focused standup* helps a team focus on effectively collaborating on the most valuable work items.

In this approach, the facilitator points out the most valuable work item on the board (often the one closest to the upper right corner of the board), and asks the team members: **"How can we move this item forward?"**

Team members can volunteer to contribute to that work item, and then the facilitator moves to the next item, and so on, until the circle members cannot pull in more work for the day.

Impediments or blocked items can be discussed during or after the standup.


### People-focused standup

Team members answer three questions in a round:

* What did you do yesterday?
* What are you going to do today?
* What stands in your way?

The facilitator supports people to be brief and to the point, making a note of all impediments mentioned in order to make sure they are addressed - either by scheduling brief discussions after the standup, or by adding them to a backlog.

The *people focused standup* is helpful when each team member mostly works in their own silo and tasks are not commonly shared.


Team members are constantly up to date with the state of the team's work and get the opportunity for contributing to other people's tasks when there's a bottleneck.


Over time this approach might translate into improvements for closer collaboration, with a team finally adopting the *value-focused standup* (above).


### Iterations or Continuous Flow

Teams working on products often use an iterative approach, planning work in regular intervals lasting for a certain period of time (the iteration). Other teams work from a prioritized backlog and hold planning sessions as needed. Teams delivering ongoing services often work without explicit planning.

The daily standup can be combined with any of these approaches and can benefit all types of work process.

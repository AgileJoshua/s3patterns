title: Prioritized Backlog
---


When work extends a certain complexity, we need way of identifying what to focus on now, and what can be dealt with later, and at the same time being sure nothing slips to the cracks.

One way to do this is through maintaining a  *Prioritized Backlog*, a list of all the uncompleted work and other matters needing to be dealt with, the most important bits on top. It's easy to pull in new work when there's capacity: simply take the topmost item you're confident you can work on.


## Benefits

There's multiple benefits to a prioritized backlog:

* when pulling in work, we know that we need to pull from the top of the backlog, so  the choice is easy and frictionless
* when we see that we are repeatedly unable to pull from the top, this is a strong indicator of a need to reorganize work processes, development of new skills, and maybe even a new mindset
* agreeing on work items and prioritization is helpful for developing shared understanding about what needs to be done and how to best approach it
* prioritization enables us to optimize the value we create by working on the most important things first 
* also, priorization helps reduce the cost of change by enabling just-in-time specification, we only talk about the details of what needs to be done when we're close to actually starting work, so we can avoid discussing detail of less important or less urgent work items which might change again before we can even begin working on it.


## Implementation ##

For collocated circles a backlog can be crated with sticky notes on a wall, or with index cards (A5 or A5 recommended) and magnets on a whiteboard. There's also many ways of implementing a digital backlog, from Excel or Google Spreadsheets, to generic tools like digital whiteboards or task planning systems, to dedicated backlog tools. It's a good idea to use the simplest tool that does the job for you. Often the minute details about work items do not need to be tracked in the backlog, if necessary we can use a reference number or a link to point us to another location, e.g. a Google Document, a Trello card, or in page in a Wiki.

Things you need to track in the backlog:

* a **unique reference number** for each work item, so you can reference the item in other documents or systems
* a **title or short description** of the work item
* the **order of work items**
* **dependencies**: other work items this item is dependent on or related to
* a **due date**, e.g. delivery date agreed on with an external party, or a date where the work item will begin to lose value rapidly (e.g. two weeks before christmas for a christmas special). Many items do not have a due date.
* (optional) a measure for **value** 
* (optional) a measure for **investment** (often an estimate of time or complexity)


## Limitations ##

Priorization requires making tough choices, and some teams are not yet ready to make them: if a team repeatedly considers two or more items as being "of equal importance", and can not agree on a default order for these cases,  the backlog will fall short on helping the team deliver the most valuable items first.

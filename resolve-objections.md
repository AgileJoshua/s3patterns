title: Resolve Objections
---


## What is it? ##

Objections in a consent round indicate emergent wisdom that seeks expression into the consciousness of the group.

There's a range of options how to address these objections by either processing them into amendments of a proposal or identifying the context where the decision in question can be made effectively.


##  Why use it? ##

It is important a group sees objections as a potential for growth and improvement. To that end the group needs ways to quickly harvest the value in objections and then move on.


## How to implement it? ##

There's various options for procession objections, usually the facilitator will select the one that looks most promising in the situation at hand.

### Facilitator amends the Proposal ###

The facilitator amends the proposal and leads another consent round.

### Those with objections suggest amendments ###

The participant(s) who had objections make suggestions how to amend the proposal.

### Suggestion-Round ###

The facilitator leads a round on the question "_How might we you resolve this objection?_"

### Proposal Owner amends the Proposal ###

The owner of the proposal will revise the proposal. They can attempt to do that on the spot, with the facilitator leading another consent round, or later, and bring the revised proposal to the next Governance Meeting.

###  Revise in a small group ###

The group consents to a smaller group to revise the proposal.

### Delegate to another group ###

The decision will be delegated to another group in the organization that is more qualified to make that decision, maybe there's even a conflict resolution group for these matters.

### Delegate to an individual ###

The group elects one person to take that decision on behalf of the group.

### Free discussion ###

Successful implementation largely depends on the level to [Artful Participation](artful-participation) in the group.


### Other options ###

If the group or the facilitator see any other way to move forward, they should take it[^and contact me so I may add it here].

### Principle: Empiricism ###

**Knowledge in an organization can only be gained through experience, as it is highly dependent on context.**

* basis of the scientific method
* in a complex adaptive system all knowledge is tentative
* embrace change: continuous revision and falsification
* reality vs. assumptions
* learning organization


### Principle: Consent ###

**Decisions are made only in the absence of reasoned objection from those affected by them.**

* when dealing with complexity, group wisdom exceeds individual abilities
* deliberately seeking objections invites collective intelligence:
    *  allows for harvesting information to improve the decision 
    *  helps identify misunderstanding early 
    *  fosters support and accountability for decisions


### Principle: Effectiveness ###

**Devote time only to that which brings you closer to achieving your objectives.**

* avoid waste
* remove impediments
* good enough for now, safe enough to try


### Principle: Equivalence ###

**Everyone affected by a decision has the power to withdraw consent on the basis of reasoned objection.**

* position, rank, function or role has no special influence in decision making

---

### Principle: Transparency ###

**All information is accessible to anyone in an organization. Confidentiality requires consent.**

* all relevant information is kept up-to-date
* historical information is archived for reference


### Principle: Continuous Improvement ###

**Evolution is more effective than revolution (most of the time).**

* applies to everything (e.g. strategies, guidelines, products, skills, processes and tools)
* respond to change by building on and transforming what is already there
* small steps create less resistance, lower risk, and accommodate steady empirical learning

---
  
### Principle: Accountability ###

**The process of entering and keeping agreements, and managing  expectations in any relationship.** 

* an obligation or willingness to do what we agree to and to answer for when we don’t
* a principle relevant to groups, organizations and individuals
* a shift from being *held to account*, and towards a culture of *self-accountability*

## Organizations ##
  
An organization is defined by its values, driver and strategy.

* an organizations values define **culture** and set parameters for **action**
* an organizations **existence** is motivated by its driver
* an organizations **service** is defined by its strategy

* organizations are aligned towards values, driver and strategy
*  with Sociocracy 3.0, *purpose* is implicit (to satisfy drivers)
* to transition towards Sociocracy 3.0 an organization:
    *  identifies values and driver of the organization
    *  incorporates vision, mission, aims or objectives in the strategy
    *  seeks out drivers for all existing policy and agreements (including circles and roles)

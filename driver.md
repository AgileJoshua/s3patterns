# Responses to a Driver #

* the response to a driver always involves the **adaptation of an existing agreement, or creation of a new one**, including:
    * changing the plan: adding a task or project
    * adaptation  or creation of a role
    * creation of a new circle
        * driver review is delegated to new circle


## Drivers Are Subject to Regular Review ##

* Is the description of the current reality correct?
* Do we still associate the same needs with the current reality?
* Is the driver still within our domain?
* Is the driver still relevant?



## Sociocracy 3.0 and Lean Thinking ##


### Value and Waste ###

**Definition**:  _The importance, worth or usefulness of something for satisfaction of a driver._

**Value**:

* value is **not** an **inherent** property as it only exists in relation to a driver
* value can be quantified by **measuring the progression** towards satisfaction of a driver
    * value is not necessarily expressed in currency or time
* **continuous improvement of processes is focused on optimizing the flow of value through an organization**

**Definition:** _Waste is anything not necessary (essential) for - or standing in the way of - effective satisfaction of a driver._

Adopting the concept of value and waste makes many tools and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** available to support organizations running on Sociocracy 3.0:

* value stream mapping
* various strategies for eliminating waste
* the Kanban Method


### Waste and Continuous Improvement ###

* Establishing a process for ongoing elimination of waste enables natural evolution of an organization towards greater effectiveness
* Adaptation to changing environment is built into the process


### Identifying Waste ###

* waste exist in many different forms and on different levels of abstraction
    * tasks, processes, organizational structure, mental models...
* some tensions reveal waste
* learning to identify waste is a journey
    * along the way we also learn how to evolve our drivers

title: Adopt S3 Principles
---


**Driver**:

* principles are reflected in all patterns
* chosen values (or implicit assumption) guide behavoiur
* need: align chosen values and S3 principles to reduce tension with S3 patterns
* need: understand principles for correct application of patterns

All patterns contained in S3 are built on seven core principles: consent, empiricism, equivalence, accountability, effectiveness, transparency and continuous improvement.

When we **Agree On Values**, we need to check how our chosen values relate to S3's principles, if there's a conflict, this will most likely result tensions with at least some of S3's patterns . 

Our chosen values should be unique for our organization, they're how we define our specific culture.

However, we can also agree on adopting S3's principles as an additional set of general principles to guide our  actions and interactions. 

This agreement would include three different aspects:

* how can we make sure everyone knows and unserstands the 7 principles?
* what can we do to help each other apply the 7 principles?
* what do we do when we suspect one or more principles are violated in a certain situation?

Each organization or group needs to find their own answers for these questions, e.g. through *Proposal Forming*, here's a few examples:

* learn and understand: print the descriptions of the principles form this handbook for everyone, then get together, pick a pattern from the handbook (at the beginning stick to those you already use), and discuss how this pattern relates to each of the principles
* support each other in application: have a poster with the agreements in your meeting room, so when making an agreements, you are reminded to check how a proposal relates to each of the principles
* suspected conflict with principles: agree on a protocol for raising concerns or asking about the intended outcome of a proposal or somebody's actions in relation to the 7 principles.

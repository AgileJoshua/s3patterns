title: Pull-System For Organizational Change
---

Change in organization (e.g. reorganizations), is commonly designed by a small group of people, often without even consulting many those affected by that change. This is not only a sure way of creating resistance to change in people, it also does not take into account the actual capacity for change, often overloading the system and therefore reducing the overall capacity of the system - the exact opposite of the intended outcome of the change. This often leads to the even more change in search of increased effectiveness. 

When instead of mandating change, we create a pull-system for change by giving the people decision making power over all agreements which affect them, they will be able to navigate both scope and speed of organizational changes themselves, growing a learning organization with a much greater chance of recovering from overload and usually preventing it altogether. 

Over time, this will allow for the transition from organizational change as a mere reaction to changes in the environment  (e.g. the market) towards intentional change. 

In context to S3, organizational change is creating and evolving agreements about how we organize and collaborate, sometimes in the form of agreeing to experiment with new patterns from S3.

S3 contains various patterns which are helpful for empowering people to pull in organizational change, here's a shortlist of where to look first:

* At the very beginning, you need to invite people to learn more about S3, e.g. through the pattern *Be The Change*
* when the group understands and *Adopts S3 Principles*, the principles can serve as an anchor for discussing potential solutions
* *Consent Decision Making* helps people to make decisions without becoming overwhelmed
* even if you don't go for decisions by consent right away, e.g. because you operate in a low trust environment, *Proposal Forming* can be used to tap creativity and wisdom of the group when preparing organizational change
* developing shared understanding of *Drivers* enables groups to find more effective solutions to problems
* *Navigate via Tensions* helps identify and tackle the most relevant challenges

Of course, taking responsibility for all decisions that affect them is tough to swallow for many groups, and different members will have a different understanding  of what makes a good decision making process. To reduce resistance, simply invite the group to try *Proposal Forming* and *Consent Decision Making*as an experiment for a month. In the absence of objections, schedule a review session with everyone one month in the future. This will create a safe space for each participant to develop an understanding of their contribution in this new way of making decisions a being accountable. They will learn to trust in the circle to make decisions every can live with, and to bring about change in a pace the circle can sustain.   Depending on an organization's culture or a circle's history, mentoring and  coaching is helpful to support the circle in moving out of their comfort zone and discovering their true capacity for change.

A pattern for...

**Driver:** 

Summary

#In a General Context

* depending on our sensitivity, we might discover many different drivers
* some of the drivers we identify are not in our domain
* some drivers are more important than others
* discussing every driver with the circle may be not effective
* we need to make a conscious choice which drivers respond to, where to respond to them, and to discuss in the circle in the first place

We consider why, how and when to respond to a stimulus, instead of defaulting to action.

>_Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom._ (Viktor E. Frankl)

The individual sensing a tension is accountable for understanding the driver and making a decision on how to proceed, whether do drop it or refer the driver to a domain (a circle or a role). In that domain, we again make a decision whether or not to act on the driver. 


## Individual Process ##

* understand and describe driver
	* what's happening and what's needed. relate each need to the conditions relevant for its existence
* Can you identify the domain (circle or role) to address this driver?
	* No: decide where to refer the driver to, or drop it.
	* Yes: refer driver to circle or role (e.g. add it to Governance Backlog)


## Circle or Role Process

* understand the driver
	* refine and consent to driver description
	* Would responding to driver improve flow of value in this domain?
		* Yes: Is it important to act on this now?
			* Yes: decide what to do, and do it.
			* No: Drop it, put it in backlog, or schedule it for review?
		* No: Might  responding to driver improve flow of value in another domain?
			* Yes: refer driver to that domain
			* No: Drop it

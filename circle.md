A circle is a semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing group of people collaborating to respond to a driver.

A circle is the basic unit of collaboration in an organization: a group of people gathered around a driver (permanently or temporarily). A circle brings together different perspectives and skills, has no hierarchy when it comes to decision making, and is accountable for its own development.

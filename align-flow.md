## Flow of Value ##

* flow of value is guided by agreements (explicit and implicit), and assumptions
* work in progress is considered waste as it ties up resources
* continuous flow of value prevents accumulation of waste
    * it also makes for shorter feedback loops and amplifies learning


## Flow of Value and Flow of Information ##

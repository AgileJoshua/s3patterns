# Flow of Value #

* flow of value is guided by agreements (explicit and implicit), and assumptions
* work in progress is considered waste as it ties up resources
* continuous flow of value prevents accumulation of waste
    * it also makes for shorter feedback loops and amplifies learning


# Flow of Value and Flow of Information #

* in an effective organization, the **flow of information and influence supports the continuous flow of value**
* alignment is achieved and maintained through continuous improvement of agreements

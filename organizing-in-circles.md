## Forming a New Circle ##

* a circle identifies a new driver and decides that creating a new circle is the most effective response
* a new circle is formed and populated
    * either from within the organization or by recruiting from the outside
* the new circle decides on it strategy
* the new circle is responsible for regular review of its driver, and for dissolving itself should the driver cease to exist

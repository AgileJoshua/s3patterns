## At a Glance: Consent and Consent Decision Making ##

* Consent is the absence of objections
    * everyone affected by a decision can "live with it"
    * consent is not consensus with unanimity
* Consent is used to make and evolve all agreements in a circle
* An objection is an argued and paramount reason why a proposal or agreement should not be implemented
* Objections stop proposals becoming agreements
* Withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization
* Being able to raise objections at any time means that proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*
* Every agreement has a review date 


Consent Decision Making...

* is a facilitated decision making process
* deliberately harvests reasoned objections in order to integrate the wisdom they contain in proposals or existing agreements
* helps balance equivalence and effectiveness
* experienced groups can move quickly through the stages of Consent Decision Making 


## Consent ##

The minimal definition of consent in this context is the __absence of argued and paramount objections from those affected by a decision__. The aim here is to quickly arrive at decisions that are good enough for now, they don't need to be perfect. 

When a group operates on consent, withholding an objection will do great harm to the group, it is a willful act of violence against the group.

The __argument__ about an objection needs to be made concerning the aims or shared goals of the group: Why would implementing a proposal prevent us from fulfilling our aims, or prevent somebody in the group from contributing towards those aims?

A __paramount__ objection is so important we cannot let it go, something I could live with (at least for a while) is often not important enough to block a proposal,  in some cases we could __consent with a concern__ and make a note to review our decision at a certain date to see if the concern still stands, we would then amend or even revert the decision.

As a rule of thumb, objections are raised when something is not *good enough for now and safe enough to try*, i.e. when one of the people affected cannot live with a decision.

When new wisdom emerges, consent can be withdrawn at any time, usually by bringing a decision again on the agenda of a [Governance Meeting][].


###  Benefits ###

Consent is the base for collaboration towards a shared goal. We cannot force people to contribute their best idea, we need to invite their contribution. Therefore consent should be the underlying principle for all our interactions in organizations.

When people share their argued and paramount objections to a proposal, the group harvests the emergent wisdom seeking expression into the consciousness of the group
and integrates that wisdom into their decisions. 

Through this process, groups are often able to create solutions that are not merely acceptable to everyone[^i.e. a compromise], but  the expression of a synergy of all the diverse perspectives in the group.

Establishing consent is a fairly quick and painless exercise for a group that is experienced with a good decision making process such as the [Decider and Resolution Protocols][] or  [Consent Decision Making][] 


### Considerations ###

You can only establish working with consent with matters that lie in your circle of influence you organization. 

Imagine a team lead, who would be able to delegate some parts of their authorities (or even everything), to the group. For this to work, the team lead themselves would have to be part of the consenting group, so they can raise objections when they feel a decision would be endanger their position in the company, as this would prevent them from contributing to the group or even take away the right for consent decisions from the group.

You need to be very clear[^as in "write it down for all to see"] what is going to be decided with consent, and what is not, to avoid discussion and discord later, when you should be making decisions. 

It is possible to establish consent without a formal process, but a following a facilitated process helps a lot with learning to navigate the challenges of consent. Experienced groups can move quickly through the stages of Consent Decision Making. For consenting to small decisions,  teams often use the _decider/resolution protocols_ or a simple consent round ([Rounds]), for more important decisions, or those with long-lasting effects,  Consent Decision Making brings a lot of benefits.  


### Other Applications ###

The principle of consent can be applied with any decision or agreement, including, but not limited to  [Proposal Forming][], processing agenda items in the [Governance Meeting][], evaluating implemented agreements, the creation of [Roles][], selection of individuals to a role, or effectiveness reviews.

### What is it? ###

_Consent Decision Making_ (or CDM) is a facilitated decision making process that allows to effectively capture emergent wisdom from the group and integrate it into synergistic solutions.

The aim of CDM is to quickly arrive at a decision that is good enough for everyone in the group, e.g. everyone "can live with" this decision. This is achieved by following a simple facilitated process and mindful participation of the group.


### Why use it? ###

A good decision making process is essential for effective collaboration and continuous improvement of a group. 

Consent Decision Making is a streamlined process that includes all the necessary steps for the group to attune to a proposal and quickly arrive at a decision that is good enough for the now and save enough to try.

The process is designed in a way that both the facilitator and the group will quickly become experts in Consent Decision Making, being able to balance equivalence of individuals and the effectiveness of the group so they can effortlessly navigate a [Governance Meeting][] with a large agenda in a short amount of time.


### How to implement it? ###

To use Consent Decision Making  with a group you need

* one proposal
* one owner for that proposal who can answer questions about the proposal
* one facilitator

It is helpful to have a driver for the circle (or team) to validate objections against, without a driver you need to resort the products to create, services to provide or any other aims, goals or objectives the teams might have.

With a new group, the facilitator first explains the process to the group. The CDM cheat sheet in the appendix may come in handy the first few times you do this.

It is important for the group to know that there will be no discussion and the facilitator will invite everyone to speak when it is their turn. The facilitator reminds the group that goal is a good-enough decision everyone can live with, not a perfect solution .


![Consent Decision Making Process](img/foundation/cdm-small.png)

#### Phase 1: Present the Proposal ####

The facilitator has the group gather in a circle and asks the owner of the proposal to briefly __present the proposal__.

For the following steps the facilitator uses [Rounds][], i.e. they pick a random member of the group to speak first and then go around the circle clockwise or counterclockwise until everyone has spoken. If the speaker is interrupted or the group starts a discussion, the facilitator gently reminds them of the process.


#### Phase 2: Clarifying Questions ####

Next is a __round of clarifying questions__, everyone may ask the owner of the proposal questions to understand the proposal. If the facilitator detects a question that is aimed to question the proposal,  they remind the group of the purpose of this round: understanding the proposal. 


#### Phase 3: Brief Response ####

When the group has no more questions, the facilitator invites everyone to __share a quick reaction__ about the proposal, usually only a few words or one sentence.


#### Phase 4: Harvest Objections ####

In the following  round the facilitator asks everyone for objections, participants may answer with  "No objection", "I have a concerns" or "I have an objection". In order to maintain equivalence in the group, the objections themselves shared in the next round.


#### Phase 5: Integrate Wisdom ####

If there's objections, now is the time to hear them. The facilitator makes sure the each objection is argued and paramount before summarizing it on a whiteboard or flip chart. 

After all the objections have been heard, the facilitator helps processing them to integrate the emergent wisdom into the decision. (see [Resolve Objection][])

If the proposal has been amended on the spot, the facilitator determines at which step to continue with the Consent Decision Making Process: presentation of the proposal, clarifying questions, quick reactions, or consent round. 

If the proposal has been deferred, the group moves on to the next item on the agenda.


#### Phase 6: Review Date and Celebrate ####

If there's no (more) objections, the group agrees on a review date for the decision, taking into account the concerns, and then records the decision, review date and concerns so they can later refer to it.

Now is the time to celebrate the decision and then move on to the next item on the agenda.


### Related Patterns ####

[Governance Meetings][] helps a group with being more relaxed with decisions, because the participants know they can refine and adapt a decision in the next iteration.

[Evaluate Agreements][] also helps with faster decisions, because any decision will automatically appear on the agenda of the Governance Meeting. For controversial topics setting a review date in the near future allows participants with concerns about the decision to view it as a short experiment that is contained safely in a time-box.
